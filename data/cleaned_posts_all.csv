travel,b6zoza,hi guys almost a year ago i had a problem with a ryanair flight which was delayed and so i sent many emails to ryanair to try to get a compensation under the eu regulation they refused to offer me any compensation and so i contacted airhelp airhelp takes care of everything for us and asks for of the compensation if we receive it however ryanair refused to pay once again even through them and so airhelp informed me that my complain was legit and they offered to go to court for another of the possible compensation which means total of the compensation which i accepted and authorized the airhelp lawyers to act in my behalf they also adverted me that it was possible that ryanair would try to get in touch with me directly in order to offer me a smaller compensation and that i should not reply to the email and forward it to airhelp instead in case that happened yesterday i did end up receiving an email from ryanair offering me a compensation but instead of a smaller one as stated by airhelp they are offering the exact amount that i should be receiving i think that ryanair knows that they would lose in court and instead of dealing with airhelp they probably prefer to pay me directly possibly to decrease the success rate of airhelp and decrease also the number of users using airhelp i think that it s probably easier for ryanair to deal with us instead of the airhelp lawyers specially when refusing to give any compensation so what should i do should i accept the offer from ryanair or forward the email to airhelp as they asked did the same thing happened to anyone what happens if i accept the offer can airhelp sue me for violationg the contract my problem is that if i accept their offer i receive of the money and if i choose to stay with airhelp i ll only receive of it any idea of how i should proceed,jokerzanchi,1553878438.0,1,0

travel,b6jb7h,i ve been really thinking of seeing some islands this summer and then later in the year for my birthday but i ve found the problem of having no idea where to begin because they all interest me so much the islands i m considering are antigua vs the bahamas vs curacao vs grenada vs guadeloupe vs puerto rico vs saint lucia i m on the east coast georgia specifically i ll most likely visit at least this year i ve never flown before and no idea will i have flown before the trip one of these trips will be with family and the other with friends meeting locals and new people is also a plus the bahamas interests me because of its beautiful waters and how easy it would take to get there but i feel like there might not be much to do unless i island hop which seems like that would add up considerably i think staying on a resort for most of the trip sounds so dull guadeloupe seems like it would be a chance to practice my french but i don t know much about there curacao interests me because at first glance it doesn t seem to be a traditional caribbean island and the ig accounts i follow who ve lived there loved it puerto rico seems like there would be a lot to do with the size of the island it being a us territory and lots of english helps as well and then i ve heard tourist dollars there would really help the other islands seem small enough that i could explore them on my own or with an excursion and that i could see most of the island in a short period tldr what are your experiences on antigua the bahamas curacao grenada guadeloupe puerto rico amp saint lucia how were the people the beaches the water what did you do there and how did you like it also specify whether you stayed in a rental hotel resort or airbnb,IssaFool,1553782525.0,1,0

travel,b5wt9q,i m fairly new to travelling and this will be my first solo trip that s more than a few days so i m a little nervous and overwhelmed from researching and would really appreciate some advice i m flying from edinburgh the timing is flexible i can extend to weeks and i haven t booked anything yet the original plan was porto gt lisbon gt seville gt madrid gt barcelona i m now thinking that this would be a bad idea as it would result in me being in barcelona around easter which i m worried would be far too crowded for my liking i know wherever i am on easter will probably be crowded but i imagine less so than barcelona current tentative plan is april barcelona april barcelona april barcelona april barcelona april early bus train from barcelona madrid april madrid april madrid day trip to toledo april madrid porto april porto april porto lisbon april lisbon april lisbon day trip to sintra april lisbon seville i don t know if this is a good idea on easter monday april seville april seville and then maybe a day or two in granada and or cordoba i m also considering visiting ronda and then flying out of malaga barcelona is the cheapest to fly in and out of but i imagine that the cost of getting back to barcelona would outweigh the difference seville and malaga are both around pounds cheaper to fly out of then porto or lisbon so that s why it s ordered that way is it dumb to go in and out of spain would it make more sense to do barcelona gt madrid gt seville other places in andalucia and then lisbon gt portugal and fly out of portugal the flight out of porto is around double the price of flying out of malaga or seville i m mildly interested in seeing an easter procession i know these are best in seville but would like to avoid crazy crowds the only places in the itinerary that are must sees for me are barcelona porto and lisbon the rest i am flexible on i am debating scrapping madrid entirely as my understanding is that it is mainly museums and those don t really appeal to me i am however a young solo traveler who is interested in the nightlife i know i would enjoy toledo so it s still on the itinerary also any recommendations for fun social hostels in any of these locations i m new to travelling on my own and would like to meet people would take any advice recommendations that y all could give me i am mainly interested in beautiful architecture wandering around old areas and experiencing the culture museums and most paid tourist attractions don t really appeal to me although i will pay to see gaudi s work in barcelona as that looks amazing i tend to walk km a day while travelling and my style is to just walk in the direction of the prettiest building i see and wander from there i also would like to meet people and enjoy the nightlife my expenses are flexible but cheaper is better and i m okay with long bus rides if that means saving money anyway thoughts on any of these things would be much appreciated i m feeling a tad overwhelmed planning on my own but am really excited to explore more of the world thanks in advance,majesticmile,1553642070.0,2,0

travel,b5s3um,hi i m posting for my in laws they booked a westjet vacation via a travel agent they asked for it to be a star all inclusive and in the beach of puerto vallarta as they have never been to pv they relied on the expertise of the agent booking the vacation they ended up at the krystal resort apparently it was not only old and dilapidated but dirty and disgusting there was garbage on the beach exposed wiring throughout the resort and staff that seemed unwilling or unable to address their concerns of which there were many some other examples of issues the pools were unlit and scummy there were dirty dishes in the hallway that were never taken away they didn t have hot water in the room until day which sporadically seemed to fix itself the only clean water that was provided were two small water bottles in the otherwise empty room fridge now i have to state that my in laws are genuinely nice people that will make the best out of any situation however when feeling unsafe and unheard it is understandable that they feel as though their trip should be refunded in some way so they have contacted the travel agent and westjet they both insist this resort was star and therefore it is not their fault there were issues westjet offered compensation to be used on another vacation on a trip that seems like a slap in the face my question is has anyone has this experience with westjet and if so how can they get a full refund or at least better compensation to feel as though the trip wasn t completely wasted,kboxy,1553619061.0,0,0

travel,b5btn2,hi my family and i parents in s kids in late teens twenties are heading to norway in july and have days to spend in between stavanger and bergen i know this is a pretty short amount of time so i d love to get feedback on our itinerary for context we re pretty active outdoorsy and are used to driving long stretches of road in the united states we ve driven from new york to florida times once from new york to new orleans we ve done tons of vacations centered around driving long distances hiking but i am recovering from a hip injury so we may have to be a bit less intense than usual here is a google map https drive google com open id dujjf o swxxahjp cmibm jtm zr a amp usp sharing that i ve used to plot out some points for our planned route i know right now is closed between hellandsbygd and hara so the map is telling us to take a huge detour through points c and d but in the summer we can drive that way directly day arrive in stavanger early morning by overnight train from oslo pick up rental car drive to hike pulpit rock done by pm drive north stopping by waterfalls along the way e g svandalsfossen latefossen stay in odda day drive to fonna ski glacier resort do glacier hike with folgefonni bref rarlag done by pm continue north and east drive towards mabodalen valley hardangervidda stay anywhere near between kinsarvik and eidfjord or east of that day drive towards bergen if time permits hang out in bergen flight out of bergen around pm questions overall is this itinerary doable we re hoping to take advantage of the long stretches of daylight in july to start as early as possible in the mornings and or drive late into evenings but i know this might seem ambitious general tips for driving in norway multiple people in our family are comfortable driving through mountain roads at night but we ve only driven in the u s so we don t know if there s anything particular to look out for in norway how long do we need to spend at stops along the route for example at the waterfalls it seems like these waterfalls are pretty accessible and don t need a lot of hiking time but i m not sure has anyone done a glacier hike with folgefonni bref rarlag how was your experience was it worth the money are there options do slightly easier routes in case my hip isn t feeling too well are there other hiking options around day or day of this route that are moderate e g i don t think we have time for trolltunga so something shorter easier than that would be great if we have maybe hours in bergen what would you suggest we do we ll have our rental car and are open to anything more outdoorsy or also anything more in the city we want to be at bgo by or before pm thanks a ton in advance,pllllllo,1553526527.0,1,0

travel,b559on,i m afraid this ll be a bit of a story and a lot of explaining to do so i appreciate anyone who takes the time to thoroughly read this i am a year old venezuelan girl going through the cumbersome process of obtaining a long term visa to study in a spanish university so far the bureaucracy has been painful but manageable i graduated from an american school but i am currently living with my aunt and uncle in venezuela as my family both of my parents and younger brother are currently living in the united states of course i can only apply for the visa in my country of birth so i m doing all the paperwork and process practically alone from venezuela even though it s a bit of a burden with all the political issues we have going on here it has not been impossible but i have one issue going on that has made me lose quite a few hours of sleep i don t know if this might result in the waste of all of my effort time and money in the past few months i m scared here goes the story almost two years ago in i graduated from high school and had to take an unsolicited unchosen basically obligatory gap year i wanted to go to university right away and was even accepted to a hard to get into university in venezuela however we all then realised that since i did not hold a venezuelan diploma as mine is american i was not allowed to actually attend the university i had to do a legalisation of my diploma which would take two years i was devastated since i was really looking forward to studying there i m a good student and i worked very hard to get the grades i got i couldn t study in america either because it is way too expensive at that time we could not even afford to pay the sat let alone american university applications so after graduating and not being able to study i was recommended that being an au pair might be a nice idea while i waited out the year time so without anything else in mind that s what i did i did my research and found a seemingly nice family in poland from an au pair website who wanted me to be their au pair for at least months i thought that it sounded great as it would give me a chance to learn a fourth language plus be able to work and explore the culture we videocalled several times and messaged much more often a trust relationship was set i did the paperwork for the visa got an invitation letter from them and was set to go i was given a type d visa for months of multiple entries to the schengen territory it was all going well when well it wasn t the family never let me join any polish courses i was working more than hours a week with just free days a month and my time outside the house was very restricted basically the opposite to what au pairs generally do there was no contract just what we had discussed which was the opposite of what i was doing but i for a fact knew that there is a time limit of work for au pairs au pairs are supposed to attend language courses and are supposed to have at least free day a week after months of what seemed like house arrest i could not take it any longer i talked with the host family several times but they never changed their behaviour so i took the decision to leave for my own mental health even though i desperately wanted to i could not go back to venezuela at that time as my family did not have the economic resourses to help me pay a flight back i still had months left of my visa and i still had my return flight ticket for the day my visa expired so i had to wait months to leave poland i couldn t find any other host families in poland at that time if i had i would have stayed there i rather loved the country i ended up finding another seemingly nice family this time in spain and after talking with the family and leaving in awkward and bitter terms i left for spain this time they truly were nice people i had the best time and created some of my best memories abroad i taught english to two lovely kids and made many friends in all the fun and finally able to enjoy my time as an au pair i did not realise something i had spent months in poland and practically months in spain while i did have a type d multiple entry to schengen countries visa this was a polish one not a spanish one i m afraid that did not give me the right to stay more than days in another country that wasn t poland i genuinely did not know of this until i was already in spain and by that time it was too late as i had surpassed the day stay there i still had a few more weeks left in spain before my flight back and no one i knew could host me in poland for the remaining weeks so i stayed in spain for the rest of my trip and every day i anticipated the worst i felt like a criminal it was not my intention to overstay there not even to go to spain in the first place as i had no idea my experience in poland would be so bad but as both are schengen countries i had no stamp for spain on my passport when i arrived or left the country just portugal as it was my layover stop and first entry to an eu country after a few weeks of paranoia and on my last days of my visa i flew to warsaw directly from spain and took my due return flight the flight back home was from poland since it was expected i d stay there for the entire time it was basically as if i had never left the country for the past months i had my passport stamped in lisbon layover stop when i first arrived to europe and had it stamped again in lisbon layover stop while leaving europe so i repeat i did not overstay my visa period at all i even entered and left poland the dates the visa said however i did stay in spain for over days whilst only holding a type d visa for poland there was no proof of that overstay or that i had even been in spain at all though i am sure someone certified could see the track of my flights if they wanted to somehow so i returned back to venezuela and no one said anything i could pass just fine i still had to wait another year to study in venezuela so i considered being an au pair again but this time taking way more precautions i was actually invited by the same family in spain to be an au pair and since they were so nice to me and we got very well along i agreed during that process of research for the visa my family left to the united states my mum got a job there but i voluntarily did not go with them as i still would not be able to go to university there this is all because i just want to study later i found out i couldn t be an au pair in spain since my native language is already spanish thus i could not get an au pair visa with no other way to get a visa in spain to stay for longer than days i ended up going to spain for less than months this time i was very afraid i would not be allowed to enter the country and that somehow the immigration would know about my previous incident but it was as if nothing had happened since i was staying as a tourist for less than days in spain this time i felt less paranoid as my stay was completely legal that time during that time my host family knowing the tough situation in venezuela and about my family living somewhere else offered to host me in spain if i wanted to study in university there i had never considered the possibility and it was already getting too dangerous to live alone in venezuela let alone without my family with me so i very thankfully accepted and after arriving back to venezuela in december we began the whole process to apply for the university in spain that leaves me to right now i am truly scared that once i turn everything in for the visa solicitude i will get my application denied because of that overstay incident that happened almost a year ago i mean my passport stamps are all fine and i have no recorded incidents in any of the european countries i visited but i am afraid that the visa people will somehow look at all the flights i ve made is that possible would they do that and see that little overstay in spain i m afraid i ll get rejected because of that and worse fined a huge amount i won t even be able to pay thus my question will the incident i just described have any effect on my visa application,trashbagging,1553482489.0,2,0

bernese alps tanzbodeli hike grimmelwald to stechelberg i found out about this trail from reddit but online resources for the tanzbodeli route are scarce i feel comfortable enough to do it but i would love for someone who has done the trail to chime in below is my best approximation of the route mostly from reading a description of the hike https imgur com a gq rmbt https imgur com a gq rmbt http www hikingwalking com destinations sw sw bernese lauterbrunnen tanzbodeli tanzbodeli detail http www hikingwalking com destinations sw sw bernese lauterbrunnen tanzbodeli tanzbodeli detail this is the only thing we have planned for the day amp x b may junfraujoch scenic train i ve always wanted to see a glacier coming from florida it is probably the most alien landscape i could possibly visit gondola from lauterbrunnen to wengen train ride from wengen to kleine scheidegg am check out the weather at junfrau and book the ticket up there i only want to reserve the first leg of the trip in case there is bad weather tickets are non refundable any thoughts i heard there was a good place to eat lunch at kleine scheidegg only thing planned for the day we might hang out in wengen any good places to eat or drink amp x b may this will either be a zero day or a day trip to bern depending on our mood bern will just be for sightseeing and drinking plan on being back in stechelberg that

suggestions for bars drinks we have an incredible airbnb booked in zermatt with a hot tub d amp x b may chill day enjoy the house get our money s worth etc cook at home amp x b may matterhorn i have ideas for this day but i am torn between them one is the new crystal ride thing that they built iiiiiii don t know how i feel about this one seems over the top luxurious and doesn t even get you close to the mountain the other is taking gondolas up to schwarzee and hiking the trail to hornilutte right at the base of the marterhorn the trail is mi round trip with strenuous uphill and my fiancee isn t a big hiker so i m not sure what to do yet morschach may train from zermatt to lucerne rent a car in lucerne and drive to airbnb in morschach my primary reason for choosing this town is because it is near the stoos ridge trail which will surely be a highlight of the trip my reason for renting a car is that i don t really have much planned here and i want the ability to do whatever i want without the confines of train bus travel it also allows for a certain logistic pertaining to a hike i want to do which will be discussed below we want to get massages on this day but i m having trouble finding a place amp x b may stoos ridge hike https imgur com a pf bdzk https imgur com a pf bdzk drive from airbnb to gondola to the east up to the ridge walking sections in blue we ll probably eat at a pizza place up there amp x b june surenenpass hike at hours my fiancee probably couldn t make it so i ll be going alone she will have the car that day to do whatever she wants and can pick me up from the end of the hike https imgur com a f jjo https imgur com a f jjo amp x b june no plans yet maybe a day trip to milan or st gallen open to suggestions amp x b june train back to zurich staying right next to airport since flight leaves at am amp x b june flight to manchester hr layover to orlando amp x b other information we are travelling with osprey farpoint and fairway l backpacks with detachable daypack the idea is we can drop the big pack at the place were staying and carry the daypack out we have a half fare card all lodging is already booked questions should we prebook major train tickets i like the idea of reserving seats but we might feel rushed at times to get to the train station junfraujoch train ride should we book in advance another note on trains and

travel,b4zidp,hi everyone i am in the middle of planning my honeymoon and i ve been considering many different ideas and i m struggling with really narrowing down my options so i wanted to see if anyone could provide any insight from their own experiences to help me figure this out background our wedding is in mid december and we really want to go on our honeymoon right after the wedding so travel time is about days before christmas and we are looking to be away for a about a week my fianc has really put the onus on me to plan the whole thing as i do travel quite a bit even though my travels are primarily limited to europe and the us but her only stipulation is that we go somewhere that allows her to relax on the beach i am pretty open to any type of trip as i can lay around on the beach but i can also do plenty of activities and be on the go i would like to take a day trip to see some natural or historic sights but i wouldn t be totally at a loss if we just were bumming around for a week either we would prefer to stay away from crazy party resorts and prefer more low key bars and restaurants in an ideal world we could mix having a unique experience somewhere different while still being able to stay at a hotel that would allow to have pool beach time from a budget standpoint i have about in travel rewards that i was hoping to use for my hotel resort so we can go pretty high end i was planning on paying for my flight out of pocket but i would be willing to dip into my points if need be we are traveling from nyc so we have some decent flight options as well ideas so far considering the time of year our location and my fianc s desire for a beach i ve been focusing on mexico central america and the caribbean i ve done a lot of research on different places but i m traveled to that part of the world so i m finding it difficult to differentiate between different places the below are the particular contenders tulum i love the idea of staying on the beach in a romantic hotel and the ability to take a day trip to see ruins my fear is that it s overrun with instagram stars and i don t truly feel like i m away holbox seems more off the beaten path than tulum but i am slightly concerned is that there is nothing else to barbados similar to tulum i m not sure how away from it all id feel and i also don t know what other activities to do i am a big fan of rum so i think the distilleries would be a fun day trip but i m not sure what else there is st lucia it seems more adventurous than barbados but i honestly have a hard time distinguishing it from other caribbean islands i just see it come up a lot as a popular honeymoon spots cabo todos santos todos santos seems like it s more off the beaten path so that s intriguing but i m not sure if the extra travel to get there is worth it that s all the thoughts i have so if anyone has any thoughts on the places i listed or have different places in mind i haven t mentioned please let me know thank you all,dmill0441,1553451458.0,1,0

travel,b4smfk,been spending the last few hours trying to re think logistics for my family s trip to croatia my old parents and my siblings and myself we re planning on renting a car and flying in out of zagreb we re already planning on spending very little time in zagreb just the first night there to get adjusted to the time and also the last night before our departing flight since it leaves in the morning option a i was initially thinking of going straight from zagreb to split spending the day and night there going to dubrovnik spending nights there then going to plitvice np spending the day there then heading to zagreb and spending the last night of the trip there this option came to mind so that we wouldn t be driving all the way to or from dubrovnik in a single drive this leaves us only half a day in plitvice or maybe krka and i read some reddit post suggesting to get to plitvice as early as possible option b that i thought of land in zagreb spend the night in zagreb head to plitvice and spend the day and night there head to split the next day and night there then go to dubrovnik and spend nights there then drive all the way back up to zagreb to spend the last night there if we decided to go with option a i don t think we could spend the last night in plitvice since it s a hour drive to zagreb and our flight is at am any better plans to do those things split dubrovnik and plitvice national park would plitvice be super busy in mid may that we should get there as early as possible would krka be a better national park to visit and how s driving in croatia i ve never driven in another country and am worried that the people driving are going to have a hard time understanding the signs,jbnpoc,1553403078.0,1,0

travel,b4n15t,i posted a while back with a general plan allotment of days we ve finally narrowed down our activities list a bit and would love any last minute tips or critiques regarding the way we ve planned the days we re not the type of people who stick to strict itineraries so the plans are more like guidelines to make sure we hit up the things we care about the most with options to add more depending on how fast or slow we take it leaving in a couple weeks day saturday arrive in singapore around noon hotel is in chinatown check in walk amp eat around the neighborhood at the hawker centres don t want to exert ourselves too much after the flight so planning to just wrap up the day by marina bay gardens for the light shows day sunday start in little india for breakfast head to kampong glam to see the mosque and for shopping at haji lane then to old airport road food centre if we have time go to orchard road for even more shopping then finish up the day in the colonial district with a drink at raffles perhaps art gallery is on the list if we feel like it enjoy nightlife in clarke quay day monday go to orchard road for shopping if we didn t go the day before followed by a trip to the botanic gardens and adam road food centre if we feel up for it head to treetop walk and then the night safari if not chill out around our hotel area again and hit up gardens by the bay if we were too tired to see them the first night day tuesday very early morning flight to hong kong hotel is in mongkok check in and rest then slowly explore kowloon area on foot ladies market street bird garden tsim sha tsui either try for an early dinner drinks at ho lee fook and the quinary followed by the victoria harbour light show or vice versa if we re not hungry that soon day wednesday take the ferry to lamma island for lazy shopping eating and hiking check out jumbo kingdom on the way there or back if it makes sense dinner at juxing home followed by cantonese opera at ko shan day thursday potential day trip to macau eat lots of food and walk around everywhere seems like we could start in taipa and make our way north or go the other way around we ll eat egg tarts and african chicken for sure the famous water show isn t showing during our trip so i don t think we ll stay too late we don t like gambling so won t spend much time at casinos i was considering doing the aj hackett bungy jump though if that wouldn t crowd the day too much day friday lantau island check out the buddha tai o fishing village and mui wo beach dinner in sheung wan if we can get the reservation we want day saturday last day in hk so want to see everything we didn t already see on hk island like hong kong park shopping in wan chai i ve got a few places saved maybe shek o beach too we have a dinner reservation in wan chai and will likely go out afterwards day sunday flight to kaohsiung mid morning hotel by liuhe night market want to check out the lotus pond pier art center xinjuejiang shopping district and ruifeng night market day monday train to tainan not the hsr hotel close ish to tainan confucious temple don t have much planned here aside from wandering around and eating food have considered checking out taijiang national park as well day tuesday hsr to taipei hotel by taipei main not sure what time we will get in depends on whether or not we want to spend more time in tainan in the morning leaving this day without many plans maybe just the huashan creative park followed by raohe night market if we have extra time we can try to hit up a restaurant on our list that s not particularly near anything else we ve planned day wednesday start at xiahai city god temple from there wander and snack down through ximendeng all the way to lungshan temple hang out in gongguan for a bit we might do this on day though if we have time hit up ningxia night market later on if we re still hungry day thursday day trip to shifen amp jiufen day friday national palace museum yangmingshan amp thermal valley and yehliu geopark maybe way too ambitious shilin night market it seems like this is a doable if busy day if this is too much we might skip shilin entirely or leave the national palace for its own day day saturday songshan cultural and creative park taipei din tai fung we re prepared for the wait maokong gondola tonghua night market day sunday our last day of the trip leaving this morning to either revisit somewhere we enjoyed a lot or hit up an area we missed due to lack of time flight home is at pm,aurorium,1553368694.0,1,0

travel,b2yhje,i am currently in spain studying abroad and i am using public transportation to get around i ve been using the public transportation option on google maps and of the time it has been accurate and helpful weekend bus schedule in my small town was not uploaded so i was stranded for a few hours but i ve noticed a problem i don t know how to solve if i am just searching for a supermarket or a starbucks leave me alone lol it s the best place i ve found for consistent wifi and i have online assignments i can sort my results by relevancy and distance however the supermarket that is the shortest distance away is not necessarily the quickest to get to when using public transportation case in point there are two supermarkets in the next town over and even though one is miles closer to me it takes over an hour to get there because i have to transfer buses and walk the other store even though it s miles further away only takes minutes to get there because it s on the bus line and i don t have to transfer as of yet the only way i have figured out to figure out the destination with the shortest travel time is just to click through all my options and remember which is the shortest i m surprised that as many people who use google maps to travel in big towns with public transportation that there wouldn t be a way to sort results by the ones with the shortest travel time does anyone know anything about this i d appreciate any help or tips thanks,thehairtowel,1553007839.0,2,0

travel,b2zmcd,so i want to au pair in italy starting september the family would like me to stay until december th that s days however the schengen visas say you have to be out after days so from my online research i have options ask the family if it s okay leave days early or apply for a student visa the student visa is looking more and more unlikely i would have to pay for the classes which are quite expensive and time consuming hours a week and the closest honorary consulate to me is hours away so it s probably easier to just get the normal day tourist visa but i don t really want to leave days early and i m scared the family will not be okay with this and will ask to find a different au pair so i guess i just have a couple questions i ve been to italy before as a tourist and didn t need a visa to enter why is this different does customs really check that you have been there for less than days do i have to get the tourist visa before i enter the country is there any way to extend a visa by a couple weeks any help is appreciated i m feeling really overwhelmed by this whole process,RebrandAsCarrot,1553013479.0,1,0

travel,b2zbhm,i m planning a night trip to london and i have thought about spending two nights at one place and two nights in another what are your thoughts on switching your accommodations halfway through a trip amp x b sure there is some inconvenience in checking out schlepping your bags to the new place and then finally checking in and getting your room however i think there are significant pros explore two different hotels or even styles of accommodations e g hotel vs hostel vs airbnb stay in two completely different neighborhoods which can give a very different vibe for example staying near leicester square and then moving over to shoreditch there can be some cost savings however i don t think moving would be worth it if staying in similar style hotels or in the same area unless the savings are massive amp x b a nyc example would be staying in midtown for days and then moving across the river and staying in williamsburg for the rest of the stay sure they aren t that far but a minute subway ride can be a mental limitation in fully exploring different hoods thoughts,welcometogoodburger7,1553012000.0,0,0

travel,b2lmdy,so i want to preface all of this with the fact that i have done extensive research and thus have been completely calm in regards to my impending trip to havana next week until people started asking my friends all sorts of questions things that i have thought of so far and insinuating w aforementioned questions that it is an extremely difficult place to go to i myself would usually assume that this boils down to the don t go if there s even the slightest deviation from buying a ticket and going mentality one that seems notorious in regards to cuba i m planning a great deal of this trip and want assurances with recent experiences more so than i do want answers several main points the support of the cuban people category i have chosen that and advised my friends to choose it i booked with a casa particular i plan on going to palabras going on tours with a local guide every intention to interact w the cuban people as i would do on any other trip and now make a brief itinerary and avoid being a patron in government run places i want to know to the best of my ability how strictly this is enforced does anyone ask at customs ask for an itinerary should i keep all my receipts ect and upon entry if there are any inquiries as well i m flying out through atlanta miami havana flying in havana fort lauderdale atlanta the visa i can buy it at the gate before i fly that is a certainty yes i know the insurance is included in the ticket for that very reason should i print a copy of the ticket just in case as for currency i think it s at the discretion of the person lots of people say edit i typed incorrectly to begin with cuc necessary primary tourist money some say both can be used i would appreciate some input as i have experienced a little residual fear and would like assurances and or insights that could either confirm or assure them but moreover so i can coherently explain to my friends not to worry it seems to be a pretty big over complicated misconception i m fairly certain it s ok if there s the slightest departure from what could be deemed a regular trip i e extra research visas many people are quick to point it out and therefore discourage people to go there are too many awesome places for that thanks for you help in advance cheers,nocturnalmusing,1552930796.0,3,0

travel,b2rlxn,a few days ago my friend and i arrived to the airport for a long awaited trip to france and spain we spent days planning and then carefully packed to stay under norwegian s strict kg carry on limit we got to the check in counter our bags squeezed in under the weight limit we were so excited but then our hearts dropped when we were told at the check in counter that we couldn t get our tickets because my friend had less than months left on her passport we came to learn at the most inopportune time possible that many european countries those in the schengen area require months remaining on your passport after your planned departure date from the schengen area now we have about dollars of expenses that we can t recoup because of norwegian airlines predatory business practices norwegian airlines does not make this month rule publicized to customers when booking even though they specialize in international travel to from european destinations and they falsely claimed that they verified our passports during the online booking process we put in the passport information including the expiration date and they gave us no notice at the time that our passports would not allow us to board the plane i asked the employee at the check in counter why we weren t told during this passport verification step and he said oh yeah that verification step doesn t do anything you could type anything into that that is what i call lying to customers i truly wonder if a class action lawsuit against norwegian airlines would be possible they are clearly lying about this verification step norwegian has been repeatedly avoiding answering what this verification step actually does in my emails to them and this is clearly not an uncommon situation for norwegian airlines i submitted expenses to norwegian airlines trying to get them to cover some of the costs of the trip that i couldn t recoup i claimed that they were negligent and lied saying that they verified my passport online only to then deny me entry onto their flight funny thing is they have a templated email to send to customers for exactly this situation in their email back to me they accidentally sent me a snippet of the template here it is if necessary pls add info related to the individual claim such as on this occasion your passport expired less than months before your return date and so on in their response to me they pointed me to the most hidden place possible in their conditions of carriage claiming it s a passenger s responsibility to make sure their documents are sufficient to enter the country it s in a section labeled administrative formalities other sections actually have useful titles like tickets and fare taxes and charges of course they make no effort to notify customers of this before booking and give a false sense of security through their fake passport verification step during the online booking process a reasonable customer would not think they would need to research any further after seeing this verification yes i know in hindsight i should have done more research but norwegian airlines really deceived me with a false sense of security with this fake verification it s clear why the company wants to do this not warning customers about passports equals more people booking tickets on their airline more change fees to their airlines when passengers are forced to change their travel plans to a later date and kicking people off the flight because of passport issues allows them to overbook flights amp x b all i want out of this is to get more eyes on this rule and enough negative press on norwegian airlines to pressure them into providing customers more of a fair warning it d be so easy for them to give a little warning banner when booking a flight to many of their european destinations and it would save so much wasted time tears sadness and lost hard earned money on vacation costs flights time off hotels events etc help me out and upvote this i don t want anyone else to go through the horrible experience we had amp x b amp x b tl dr you need at least months left on your passport after your planned departure date from many european countries those in the schengen area norwegian airlines had an online passport verification step which claimed our passports were verified that was a lie it does nothing the norwegian airlines agent at the counter said we could have typed anything into the verification tool we weren t allowed to board our flight because our passport expired in months norwegian airlines then accidentally sent me an internal piece of a templated email after i contacted their customer service this snippet they accidentally sent shows that rejecting customers with passports expiring in less than months is likely a common business practice for them they of course provided zero refund edit unsurprisingly there s a lot of internet muscle flexing going on in the comments about how dumb i was not to do more research the problem is the average poster here is far better informed on what they need to do to travel internationally than the average traveler there remains a lot of room for improvement to make this rule easier to learn about for the average traveler i maintain main points it s unintuitive for the airline to claim that my passport is verified for travel when it s actually not if they re not actually checking it they should make that clear travelers have no way of knowing they could type anything into that verification box airlines should simply put up a warning banner about the schengen area rule when booking flights into this area it d be the customer obsessed thing to do it s an incredibly simple rule months past your planned departure date putting up a warning with info about the rule would expose them to no liability the reality is a lot of people don t know about this rule and don t know to need to look for it putting up a warning would only yield less sadness in the world as it would help prevent travelers like me from a horrible experience it s a simple user interface change that would have huge impact despite all the negative sentiment i m getting here i still hope someday someone stumbles upon this post and learns about this rule and avoids a bad experience because of it to those of you flexing your muscles in the comments not everyone knows what you know making the information about this rule easier for the average traveler to learn about would only make the world a better place no need to trash those who don t know about the rule,traveler__123,1552961850.0,0,0

travel,b2d5o7,hey all in the summer i will be traveling to europe and while looking at flights i saw a huge difference in prices a nonstop flight through one airline was nine hours and about while a five hour layover making total travel time fourteen hours flight was substantially less money that s about a difference however if i do the layover flight i will likely be traveling alone and won t know what to do for five hours i think i would be morning noon in the country during the layover for those wondering how much money matters to me or whatever is a big difference in flights while the round trip price is understandable saving all that money would be nice but i don t usually do layovers and that would make the total travel time a long time in a way i d rather stick out the nonstop flight but i m not sure personal stories related to this would be great to hear thanks,lilspaghettigal,1552875399.0,4,0

Fitness,b7nwk1,serious question sorry if this was debated dozens of times before if you are natural will it really make a differernce if you re weight lifting or just doing pushups dips pullups for your upper body the reason why i m stressing on natural is because you ll never be so cut to notice every little muscle development i know that in the grand scheme of things there will be some weaknesses but are they even noticaboe if your hypertrophy is natural for instance going from max pullups to max pullups in half a year while slowly gaining weight is going to induce hypertrophy in the lats and biceps as much as weighted pullups curls and rows would arguably maybe even more given that you re not overworking your joints with added weight and so you re recovery time is faster thus more room for volume same thing for dips pushups yeah you can bench ohp but going from normal pushups to doing decline pushups while slowly bulking is going to induce hypertrophy in the chest shoulders triceps just curious as to why some people see bodyweight training as inferior,YesVeryKewl,1554039930.0,4,0

Fitness,b7oil4,i m overweight and currently lifting as my main form of exercise for weight loss it s going really great i m slowly getting stronger and it makes me feel great however i have long working days and especially when i work the early shift i find myself really tired the timing would be perfect for me to work out but when i do i notice that i lack some strength to push myself to my actual max i get really demotivated when i have crappy workouts and feel bad about them afterwards a friend suggested i use a pre workout she uses one that is targeted towards women on those days to give me a little extra push i really liked the sound of it but was wondering if it will actually make a difference or is even necessary at this point in my journey i m not lifting super heavy weights but it s still a strain on my body and i notice that on days when i m tired it s really hard for me to get over that would love to hear some opinions thanks in advance,BornZebra,1554043615.0,0,0

Fitness,b7cewn,so i was a gym goer in the past i feel comfortable with all the various machines i m aware of the number of sets reps that s usually reccomened etc due to my current living situation apartment lack of time and money for a gym i built a mini workout corner in my garage i e workout bench bar various sized weights call me lazy but after work i just don t have the energy to do a full workout to sit there doing multiple sets i ve been doing just one set with as many reps as possible till i can t push myself further so basically situps until i cant eek one more out shoulders until i can t lift the weights properly etc my question is is this the least efficient method ever i know it s definitely not the most efficient but coming home from work and thinking of doing multiple sets seems too daunting for me at this point and i can t get motivated thinking of doing each muscle group just once seems easier for me to manage is this a total waste of time for me i m hoping that in the summer when my workload gets lighter i ll be able to do some normal regiment but right now i can t seem to get myself to do it and this is the only way i can get myself to workout i know it s more mental than anything i m probably spending the same amount of time as if i just did the normal amount of sets also i m female late s fairly active on the weekends with hiking and tennis don t know if that info helps suggestions advice thanks,Drbiggieballs,1553959255.0,0,0

Fitness,b6ax6x,hey guys i am a year old male currently lbs with an estimated body fat based on the navy body fat calculator i have been in my weight loss journey since september of and started at lbs at first i was only changing my diet to whole foods and counting macros about months ago i started weight training doing stronglifts x program i have made decent progress on the program but feel like i am wasting potential due to doing a linear progression program while at a deficit my goal is to get to at least body fat and then start to clean bulk to make some mass gains i currently feel like i am losing weight at an extremely slow pace approximately lbs a week if any loss at all my question is involving a routine swap i have access to p x which is a lot more cardio focused than i currently am working on would it be wise to swap to p x and do it for months to try to push through this last body fat so i can start my bulk and actually be able to progress on a strength program or should i stick to the strength focused program and possibly take even longer to get to my bulking phase i am currently eating around calories a day i don t feel comfortable dropping any lower than this and have tried to up my workouts to create the deficit needed i am worried that if i do p x i could lose the strength gains i have made but at the same time i am worried that doing just the strength training is causing me to stall at my current body fat percentage while the deficit makes me unable to gain the strength needed to progress further any advice is greatly appreciated as i really want to get this last bit of stubborn fat off before the summer and start working on some real mass gains thanks,sempiternal08,1553726406.0,0,0

Fitness,b60uc5,hi everyone just a little background i ve been lifting for roughly a couple of years now and when i first started i did the classical bro splits chest biceps back triceps shoulders legs and would always go to failure after around months i stopped going to failure and increased my volume and had better results then i switched to doing upper lower body workouts and split my total volume in workout sessions the problem is that i didn t feel like i was doing enough during my workout session because my muscles didn t feel fatigued enough so i started increasing my volume too much and ended burning myself out now my question is this is it worth going back to training each muscle group twice a week if you ve been working out for almost years if it is how should i go about splitting up my routine and how can i gest past this feeling that if i don t have serious doms the next day it means that i didn t push myself enough,CaptainKidd96,1553667063.0,4,0

Fitness,b62mqx,i did a search on this any the general response is it s ok as long as your form is good but you should use the standard bar if possible i ve been using the standard bar until now but tried the ez today i found that because the curves allow me pull the bar an inch or two closer around my legs it felt like the lift was much better centred down the middle of my body rather than extending forward which feels less safe for my back i have no issue with the altered grip is this a good reason to keep on using it or is engaging the back muscles with the bar further forward a key element of the deadlift and basically i need to work on my form,hazza26uk,1553681273.0,0,0

Fitness,b5x2tt,today i was doing front squats for nsuns so it was a lot of sets i was experimenting with putting my grip narrower and narrower each set just to try to find a slightly better setup eventually i did a set where as soon as i unracked the bar kind of rested on my index fingers so that my fingers were pressed between the bar and my shoulders it wasn t crushing them or anything more like pressing against them i continued the set and found that the bar felt much more stable than usual and more comfortable i felt like it took much less effort to keep the bar from rolling forward my fingers were like bumpers keeping the bar in place i did a few more sets like that on purpose afterward my question is is this a bad idea for some reason i ve seen a lot of discussion of front squat setup and i ve never seen anyone suggest doing this why not,Carett,1553643539.0,3,0

Fitness,b5t9u3,as with many people in this sub i m looking to be a healthier version of myself i train weights times a week run and swim once a week and am always looking for ways to improve my diet as a ft kg male my bmi is which is points away from obese since i ve been weight training a number of years i tend to ignore bmi so started looking into body fat percentage i have had my bf calculated in a couple of different ways which put it in the range room for improvement but overall not too bad if at kg i have kg of fat that s body fat which is generally considered to be an ok level if by some miracle i manage to bulk to kg without putting on any fat or say bulk cut to that point my bodyfat percentage would drop to which is reasonably lean but i d still have kg of fat on my body due to the change in body fat percentage it would be considered healthier but the amount of body fat has not changed does this mean by gaining muscle mass you negate negative impacts of body fat or just at higher body weights a higher proportion of your body weight can be fat or is this just a problem with using body fat percentage to look at health i appreciate fat isn t inherently bad but leaning down from would probably be considered to be healthier tldr if you maintain the same amount of fat but gain lean mass your bf drops does this mean you are healthier even if you haven t lost any fat,skadoosh40,1553624704.0,4,0

Fitness,b5p68g,hey guys just looking for some opinions on what i should do i have been doing hypertrophy training tuesday and thursday while on wednesday and friday have been mma training the person i do the hypertrophy with said that in order not to ruin the gain of tuesday and thursday if i do my usual hiits it should be sunday my question is if i should just keep doing that or if i can incorporate instead of hiit doing some running even mid week around kms runs on days that i don t have the hypertrophy training although i read its also possibly doing the running well before the training doesn t affect it edit my goals are to gain more muscle overall while losing body fat percentage at the same time which i have been told can be difficult since usually hypertrophy means eating more to gain more mass from what i read i have currently been eating less on non hypertrophy training days my maintenance calories should be around so on those days i aim for and on those training days i eat a bit more before the trainings of carbs which is why i also wanted to incorporate some cardio to lose the fat also my meals are usually pretty heavy on protein and i also have been drinking one of those protein supplements thanks in advance,devm22,1553603826.0,9,0

Fitness,b5f4pu,i ve been doing some research and reading up on fitness routines of various different bodybuilding competitors a lot of them mention doing weight training and then supplementing their training with minutes of hiit or liss cardio daily to help them get and stay lean i understand that when losing weight it s important to be at a caloric deficit and too large of a deficit and overtraining can have the opposite effect by slowing down your metabolism and forcing the body to retain fat hence why a lot of folks recommend losing lb of bodyweight per week at calories from your daily tdee could someone explain the mentality behind this style of training does it actually help them lose weight by putting them at a greater deficit in which case why is their metabolism not effected why train more instead of just eating less i know some bodybuilders have very limited calories but a lot of the ones i came across had plenty of calories to play around with so i don t understand the ideology does the increased amount muscle mass raise their metabolism enough to not be impacted does it simply allow for them to eat more food during their training just trying to expand my knowledge edit i totally understand that weight training should be combined with cardio for overall health benefits i m just curious about bodybuilders specifically and how they go about their training for competitions,melody0505,1553541983.0,5,0

Fitness,b56suy,hi r fitness i m an year old male who s on the skinny side and one of my goals this year is to gain weight i ve been lightly going to the gym since high school i m a first year university student but i never found i could stick to it i ve been looking for other options and other sports to gain weight and i think i ve finally settled on swimming i ve read some threads on bodybuilding com https bodybuilding com and asked a couple of friends if trying to swim to earn mass is an ideal way to gain weight and from what i ve gathered it seems to be that it s not the best method of doing so one of the biggest reasons is apparently swimming is more of a cardiovascular exercise than it is a muscle strengthening exercise i m here to ask if it s possible to gain some size by swimming it s a sport i genuinely love doing but i do have a goal in mind that i m working towards and i d love to get to that point for context i am currently cm in height and pounds lol thanks in advance i ll provide more context as needed,tubeii,1553492719.0,0,0

Fitness,b4xr4p,hi i m a climber but i tend to be to heavy for my sport i would like to get back to running to get lighter as i usually do caloric deficit but i really like to eat haha also i deadlift for lower back and hormonal gains but loosing some leg mass would be great for my sport so it seem like a better option i know running is catabolic it s perfectly fine for me even desirable on the lower body however i absolutely need to keep my back and mostly forearm size so my question is will running thinking about getting back on doing km a week only burn muscle which are used for it or does it change the fiber type of the body overall also if it does impact the upper body would it be best to hit a workout after before running to make the body keep the muscle or will the temporary caloric deficit make it even more catabolic i know this is a sort of small impact but i m at a point where every count and i need to get ultra shredded to peak so i always tend to loose some gains going in my performance phase i would like to limit that as much as possible thanks,MacheteHS,1553442402.0,7,0

Fitness,b4xrao,edit i ll see if i can calculate my tdee with myfitnesspal and see the results unfortunately the app is not logging in but i ll look into it amp x b for the past two months i have been struggling to lose just the last bit of fat that i want to lose to be more specific just a few more inches on my waist which are stubbornly resilient to almost everything that i tried to do so far amp x b despite this this has been going on back and forth with little progress or there come those two days of what seems to be a bit of progress but all of a sudden my body just goes back to where it was amp x b despite this i have been told repeatedly that i still lost weight or still look like i lost weight even though my measurements weight and chest waist and hip measurments stayed roughly the same although i would say roughly open close inspection of my body i have to say that they had a point because i do look a bit thinner than i was months ago and even my clothes say that as well because they feel bigger it does not make any sense but the information does not lie and it is very possible that i look more thin than before because of the lower glycogen levels because of the lower amount of carbs in my diet amp x b now i have tried plenty of things and i am also still learning about the right diet and workout plan i changed my diet a little bit kept my tdee at a calorie deficit made sure that i got the adequate amount of protein and fats but less carbs tried to calculate every meal that i cooked although i do admit that i had the occasional cheat meal or cheat day and i will get to that a bit i took this very diligently but i still feel like i have not managed just yet amp x b not only that but the cravings are incredibly strong almost every day it is as if i am anticipating for the next meal not exactly hungry but just really anticipating it or craving it and sometimes just to keep my mind sane and focused i sort of cheated or used the iifym approach to make sure that i stayed on track but it was not the first time this mostly happens on weekends where i just did not care about my tdee or any of the macro calculations and just eat what i desired sometimes even had seconds right after a meal like a big plate of pasta or a few more slices of biscuits amp x b i know that cravings desire for the occasional pizza or burger or whatever guilty pleasure food is common especially when you are on a strict diet or on the cutting phase this happens almost every day and i try to compensate for this amp x b but despite this and despite how i keep on realising that week after week or after every two weeks my weight and measurements stayed almost the same give or take a half inch or an inch here and there i am still told that i look like i lost weight perhaps muscle mass and i am realising that that seems to be the case after i thoroughly inspected almost everything that i could think of to confirm this before and after pictures how my clothes fit my neck circumference relying on the comments of people who are professional about this and so on and not the same that the craving are persisting constantly amp x b i find this very baffling as it does not seem to make sense but somehow this is actually happening amp x b thoughts,sammyjamez,1553442426.0,9,0

Fitness,b472fr,hi everybody i made this post a few days ago on r bodyweightfitness https www reddit com r bodyweightfitness comments b z d pike pushups are an excellent progression and it was a huge hit so i m sharing it with you here as well link to the complete blog post here https antranik org pike pushups as a fun experiment i did pike pushups as the only progression exercise to see how many it would take to translate to a single handstand pushup hspu i documented that entire journey in a part series on my blog here https antranik org tag hspu and as i got intimately acquainted with this exercise i put together all the things i learned along the way to help you succeed with it too so in this post i will point out what is proper form amp how to set yourself up for consistency so here goes pike pushups are more technical to setup and execute than expected changing any single one variable can make the exercise seem a lot easier or harder so having a consistent setup is crucial for success and because it s a difficult exercise it s easy to do it with bad form without even realizing the body is taking shortcuts some people find pike pushups so frustrating to master that they resort to doing the barbell equivalent the overhead press because they can incrementally increase the load on the bar with far fewer variables to deal with i m here to help you to not experience that frustration pike pushups done with proper form are deceptively hard i mean like really hard it s very difficult to perform them with proper form so hard in fact that most demonstrations on youtube are shown with poor form gif demonstration of pike pushup https gfycat com ifr dimthirdivorybilledwoodpecker section how to do pike pushups with proper form form check just like with normal pushups the elbows should not be flaring out to the sides since this is a progression exercise toward handstand pushups it s important to note that a real handstand pushup will never be performed with the elbows flaring outwards as such during pike pushups the forearms or elbows shouldn t be moving backwards or flaring out to the sides as well they should remain vertical and fairly static to facilitate this turn the hands out slightly so the index finger faces forward you can even make it more extreme so the thumb faces forward if your wrists are bothered gif bad form good form front view https gfycat com ifr electricoddballfly form check your head should go much more forward than you think is enough this is definitely the offender of all people dip their head down to go between their hands no stop that the head should not go down between your hands the head should go forward and down so far forward that your head ends up ahead of the fingers so far forward that the elbows don t move backwards whatsoever but maybe they even go forward a teensy bit when you re even stronger when in doubt go more ahead than you think you can in any harder variation like a hollowback press or bent arm planche your head will need to go even more forward gif bad form good form side view https gfycat com ifr thisvacantfalcon what happens if you put your head straight down between the hands the elbows flare out to the sides and it increases the strain on the elbow and shoulder joints you ll be able to do more reps with this improper form misleading you to think that you re stronger than you actually are remember this exercise is deceptively hard when done right form check your nose should touch the ground rather than aiming for the top of the head to touch the ground have the nose touch it you get more range that way form check practice full range of motion rom this goes without saying press up until arms are straight and the shoulders are over the wrists section how to set yourself up for consistency setup tip start with feet elevated decline pike pushups doing pike pushups with feet on the ground is ok but i suggest you start with decline pike pushups where the feet are slightly elevated this will mitigate any hamstring flexibility issues and make the exercise feel less awkward even if the flexibility is not an issue i highly recommend it also one should be comfortable with regular pushups if you have been doing pushups properly the way i recommend https youtu be df dowzf then you have a solid base setup tip the hands should be about shoulder width apart setting the hands far wider than shoulder width will feel easier because there s less range of motion setting the hands narrower than shoulder width will feel very difficult and is an advanced variant keep the hands at around shoulder width apart for optimum range and intensity setup tip choose an object you could elevate your feet on and stick to that height i put my feet on a chair about knee height and did that for weeks minimum before elevating the feet onto the couch about hip height and doing that for weeks pic left feet elevated to knee height on a chair is about of my bodyweight right with feet at hip height on couch this is about intensity https i imgur com e ywch jpg the difference between the above settings for the feet is only which doesn t sound like much but it is considering the chair setting is already quite difficult at intensity so don t start at the highest possible setting this exercise is humbling the height of the feet should be the same for a while setup tip place the feet near the edge of the platform when i was using a chair i would make sure my feet were placed right near the edge of the chair if i placed the feet further back toward the middle of the chair the exercise would be far easier when i elevated the feet to hip height i was using the side of my couch luckily arm rest was narrow so i couldn t set my feet too far back or forth setup tip if using a movable object to put your feet on always place them in the same spot when i was using a chair i would place the legs of the chair exactly at the edge of the carpet each and every time then my feet would go at the end of the chair and my hands would go on the same spot on the carpet everytime and finally when doing the actual pushup my nose would always hit the same spot on the carpet as well gif example of what constitutes a consistent setup https gfycat com ifr portlyimpureitalianbrownbear setup tip use a landmark for where your nose should touch for each and every rep do this to ensure you re going forward enough on the carpet i chose a pattern to aim for one inch forward or backward makes a huge difference so i always made sure i was going forward enough on a smooth floor i use a piece of invisible tape to mark the spot example pic this is how i chose to remember where to place my hands and nose each time https i imgur com vazb jpg setup tip the distance of the hands from the feet should always be the same setup the hands close enough to almost be an l shape but not tighter than an l shape this was a distance of about meter for me your mileage may vary setup tip don t place the hands too close to your feet even if your flexibility allows for it the closer you bring the hands to the feet the harder the exercise becomes so you might think closer is better to maximize the intensity but it s not the best course of action for consistency sake because placing your hands further back makes the exercise exponentially harder as mere millimeters change the load significantly if your hamstring flexibility and pike compression is great and you can compress yourself tighter than an l shape you may be tempted to make the exercise harder by simply moving your hands backwards but the inconsistency can cause frustration and make you think you re weak so don t do it note i m not saying you should never bring your hands close eventually you will be able to place your feet close to your hands do a pike pushup and lift your feet up and press up into a handstand you can even teeter totter like that if you stay piked and are obscenely strong but you need to choose a setting that s going to help you get the reps in tempo tips gif demo of appropriate tempo to aim for https gfycat com ifr creativecourageousdragonfly don t rush the negative phase slow down the negative phase so it takes a solid seconds rather than just one second or less in doing so you build more strength and make better use of your time pause at the bottom occasionally this strengthens you in the hardest part of the exercise and forces you to press up using all your strength without utilizing the elastic nature of your muscular tissues because you made all the potential energy dissipate from pausing explode up with good form in the beginning it was hard to push quickly it was actually impossible but the intention is what matters i tried to pushup as fast as possible and although it was slow it got slowly faster it wasn t until exactly one month into the training where i was pushing actually faster for the first time during the concentric phase after months i could feel the quality of my strength had changed dramatically i could muster through reps where otherwise it would ve failed in the past and perform the concentric faster than ever so there you have

gardening,b76da6,a few years ago i germinated a couple of things in paper towels just to try it but that was the only time i ve done it i ve read that sometimes it s the best way for difficult seeds to grow and i m wondering whether any of the seeds i have this year would be best done this way i m not having much luck finding specific answers on google i just keep finding instructions there s also the fact that i m not going to be able to get a starter tray together and set up for at least a few days so i figure it might be worth using paper towels to get some started sooner since i have them on hand now i m getting nervous about starting too late especially with any of the longer days to harvest plants are there any particular types of seeds that just do a lot better with paper towel germination and do you just wait until the roots have been out a few days and move them to a starter tray if you aren t ready to plant outside yet amp x b the types of seeds i have so far are marketmore cucumbers pickling cucumbers pepperoncini glass gem corn pumpkins spinach lettuce romanesco broccoli hollyhock strawflowers and sunflowers from what i know i m thinking i ll direct sow the corn spinach and lettuce at least also does anyone have any tips for any of these plants and growing them from seed just if any of those stick out to anyone who reads and any advice particular to any of those plants comes to mind and does anyone have any special tips for helping flower seedlings thrive and actually grow into flowers i tend to have horrible luck with flower seedlings sprouting but then just dying out after a couple weeks sorry i know that s pretty general advice to ask for but i just really want to get things right this year and would be so grateful for any advice i definitely plan on doing more research but i ve had a habit of half assing any gardening i ve done in the past and want to do everything i can to do it right this time thanks so much,wtfafafa,1553915035.0,3,0

wine,b75tem,wondering what others buying and drinking habits are when it comes to wine my gf and i always drank wine on occasion but recently started to take a big interest in wine i decided we would take and buy some wines to fill a wine fridge so over the course of about a month we bought and we about bottles of wine mostly what i would say are common wines wines we see everywhere orin swift oyster bay prisoner etc we have made a few purchases from vivino that weren t available locally wines that we looked up on ct to see costs and total bottles owned to get an idea if it s a real value we have bought from costco hy vee and several local wine shops now that we have some inventory we probably drink to bottles a week we usually go to a wine store or times a month and drink a bottle and take a different bottle home we have a couple we really like that we replace if we drink what we had curious as to what others habits are how often are you drinking wine how often are you buying wine are you drinking the same wines regularly or always a different wine buying wine in the grocery store we have a few with some good selection wine store online all of the above,bart1218,1553911484.0,2,0
wine,b6uxq2,hi first post here don t want to seem as some dick but i m genuinely confused about this sometimes i read things along the likes of black earth red fruit black pepper or spices i understand these type of profiles and can place them sometimes however i get some funky names like succulent black cherry or blue spring flowers or green dried tree bark or juicy citrus are those actual profiles or expanded names by some snobs who think they are fancy and want to sound professional by using such terms cause i sure haven t had a wine which has notes of flowers which i can name by colour i recognise some of these flavours but all the adjectives why thanks in advance,eligoscreps,1553850325.0,29,0
wine,b738k5,was at the wine bar last night and i asked for a recommendation on a dry red waitress offered me a new wine they got from washington i tried it and almost immediately felt this warm fuzzy almost prickly sensation on my skin a few minutes later i noticed my arms were itchy i looked and around the sides of my elbow i noticed my skin was very red and blotchy my wife then asked what was wrong and why my face was so red then noticed my neck was very red it looked like a sudden rash in these places the waitress came back to ask how i liked the wine and was like oh my god i then asked for a beer instead and about an hour later the red was almost gone so random i ve had so many different types of wine before and never experienced this anyone know what it could have been some reaction to sulfites in this particular wine or a certain grape it was a red blend need to look up the grapes my wife and others at the bar also had a glass of the same bottle and they had no averse reactions i ve never had any known food allergies or any reaction of this type to anything this was like my first allergic reaction to something,BMonad,1553896386.0,0,0

wine,b68hsu,i am in the process of opening up a brewpub where the main focus will be on beer but we want to have a handful of wines available as well for those who don t drink beer my question is is there much of a push in the wine world to drink local its a big thing for craft beer right now but since wine is more closely associated with terroir is drinking local as big of a deal i would imagine that since grapes can t be grown everywhere higher quality would be more important than being local with beer you can pretty much ship your ingredients in from almost anywhere but grapes would be more difficult thanks,zreetstreet,1553714665.0,3,0
wine,b61hz0,my father in law is in town and we were discussing his favorite memories of growing up on a vineyard in rural france circa s he told me of a type of pitted purple grape that was the most delicious that he ever tasted while his parents grew a couple plants of it they never made it into wine as it would become vin fou and make the person mad crazy apparently making it was outlawed by the local government when his father was a child he has very fond memories of this grape but has no idea the species name most of his family is deceased so there is no one to ask i would like to obtain and grow these grapes in my pasture as a surprise for when we next see him can anyone guess this species his childhood home was in sarth france edit wow thank y all so much for all of the info thus far it is amazing to have a community of knowledge at one s fingertips i shared this info with my father in law this morning and he was wildly impressed i only just got my phone back from him as he has been reading all of the links if you know something else please share edit does anyone know where i can buy noah grapevines,Septumas,1553672059.0,21,0
wine,b6bbm3,hey r wine i have been lurking on this sub for some time now wine is an interest of mine however my preference is for the reds as spring time is soon over us my father have asked me to find some great whites not the sharks though to explore the world of white wine and since it is a good chance to broaden my horizon i have accepted the challenge our taste is quite similar both of us prefer very spicy and punchy red wines syrah shiraz grenache and tempranillo are among the favorites when it comes to type of grapes if it helps we generally prefer very earthy champagne it may be a better indicator for our taste when it comes to white wine what can you recommend me our budget is between per bottle so within that price range we are located in europe so unfortunately american wine boutiques are out of reach for us thanks in advance,AKWRater,1553728522.0,1,0
wine,b66r9h,for an upcoming weekend menu i m looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals if possible i d like to use a wine for multiple meals i m aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options especially since we cook relatively non standard so feel free to suggest to meal specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus no worries if it is sub optimal i m trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically the meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed first meal is a fish based dish with fennel not more details depends on the fish we can buy second is cottage spinach stuffed sweet potato recipe http www kiddieliciouskitchen com sweet potato skins third is lamb balls in yogurt curry sauce recipe https ethnicspoon com kofta kari what would you recommend we have a fairly varied cellar though some notable wines are lacking i also have a bottle of le chemin d eolie sur lie muscadet s vre et maine sur lie with a repour so ideal if that would match one of the dishes beyond that i d like to try a canadian ice wine of which i have several but i m guessing as a sweet wine that would be hard i d like a heavier red out of personal taste but i m afraid it wouldn t match that well with whats on the menu multiple suggestions for both red and white if possible so we can select a good bottle from our existing cellar,Kalenden,1553706316.0,4,0

previous posts that i love the wines of pax mahle when i found out his assistant started making wine too i knew i had to try them i can honestly say they are some of the most exciting new wines i ve tasted in years in the process of begging for an allocation i was able to talk to the man himself and discuss some interesting topics including skin contact whites natural wine and more i think guys will enjoy the discussion sorry it s not the best audio this is my first one last year s release each vintage has new art from different artists https i imgur com zqpri b jpg click here to listen to the interview https soundcloud com mason balistreri talking obscure grapes natural wine and skin contact white wine with scott schultz of jolie laide or read the transcript on my medium site https medium com masonbalistreri the beautiful ugly impossibly delicious wines of jolie laide winemaker interview b fe d or stay on reddit and read it here audio starts mason i wanted to thank you for the allocation of syrah i know all your wines are in pretty high demand how much wine do you make what is your production size scott yeah we re probably just over the to cases mark as of this year so we re getting there we chip away at it every year we started in with two tons and every year we just add a little bit more mason do you have a size you want to max out at scott you know that s always kind of a funny number depending on who you ask a lot of people kind of quote that range as being pretty sustainable a lot of what we do those resources are relatively finite so if it can get into the to range that would be pretty amazing even getting there might be a struggle but that seems pretty ideal i was always shocked by people s myopia they d drink chard pinot cab it was really limited it just kind of drove me nuts image of melon label https i imgur com qtlehpy png mason nice so i wanted to ask you about some of the grapes you work with trousseau gris melon de bourgogne valdigui these are not the most recognizable grapes why do you work with these unique varietals scott it s kind of a funny thing so i m going to give you a miniature backstory coming from chicago i ve literally other than this only just about ever worked in restaurants and in just about every single capacity too from dishwasher busboy bartender and some back of the house stuff a lot of different positions in the kitchen the eventuality was in end of beginning of the keller group and the girl that i d been dating at the time moved us to california she was working at french laundry and i was working at bouchon it was such a transition coming from a lot of fine dining in chicago where the wine lists are so worldly and often very eurocentric to then coming to napa where even the wine bar of bouchon was it was half french and half domestic which even that is very constricting but i was always shocked by people s myopia they d drink chard pinot cab maybe bordeaux blend maybe sauvignon blanc it was really limited it just kind of drove me nuts so a lot of things were borne out of that like the the name jolie laide it s idiomatic but it s unconventionally attractive it literally is beautiful ugly that is different but good so a lot of things were borne out of that like the the name jolie laide it s idiomatic but it s unconventionally attractive it literally is beautiful ugly that is different but good it s usually reserved for a woman who looks a bit different but is kind of better for it it was a term that had just been floating around in my head anyway that i d read many years ago and it just became so pertinent when we were starting this because for those same reasons i couldn t believe that people didn t like gamay or ribolla or vermentino or whatever it is you wouldn t eat the same thing every day or listen to the same music every day but people choose to drink the same wine every day it just doesn t make any sense to me you wouldn t eat the same thing every day or listen to the same music every day but people choose to drink the same wine every day it just doesn t make any sense to me so when there s so many people here be it raj and sashi and ehren jordan and all the guys who do chardonnay and pinot noir so well why would you want to compete with that they already do it there s not really something missing there and there wasn t well there is but not as much focus on a lot of the others grapes and like i said just because yes gamay had been ostracised from burgundy a long time ago but just because you drink pinot noir doesn t mean you can t drink gamay or try a frappato just because you drink cabernet doesn t mean you can t try a cab franc they re still great and they re beautiful and they re delicious they re just not what you re used to or familiar with or what your friends drink mason is there some sort of price advantage to working with obscure varietals i mean growers struggle to sell valdiguie or maybe they don t nowadays but is it easier to get in and start making wine with those grapes as opposed to cab or pinot scott that s definitely a yes and no question sure the ability to command a high price for some of these obscurities has shifted quite a bit the first year i bought trousseau gris i think we paid a ton or something like that it literally used to be blended into hartford court chardonnay as you know you re allowed a certain percentage of other varieties or whatever you want to blend in and that whole vineyard was being blended away because nobody really wanted it it was pax who i worked for for many years he was the first one to start working with the trousseau gris in the year i came over to work with him he said you know you can make a ton or two if you want it wasn t that i d worked a couple of harvests and i felt like i know it all i m going to start a wine brand it was more pax is going to let me make a ton or two just as a tangible learning experience let s see what happens if i don t have someone telling me what to do just use intuition so that s where i began he said well what would you want to make and i said well i d love some of the trousseau gris it s so fascinating to me being a lover of trousseau but i get it there s probably none out there or you have it all and he was like no there s ten acres tons of it out there nobody wants mason that s amazing scott it s so funny and that paradigm has shifted greatly be it myself and tegan turley and especially the people before me like petroski larkmead massican winery and matthiasson the fact that we now pay about a ton and they ve literally threatened to take it away from us because their waiting list is so long now that one in particular is one of the few if only remaining vineyards of trousseau so that one s a little bit different but sure there s old vine valdiguie and even more so zin and carignan so those are the ones that are a little bit easier even those prices have gone up so yes is half the answer but the other half is no using things like gamay and melon it s such an obscurity that it s a huge pain in the ass you have to travel you have to go to regions that are y know just like any kind of real estate where we re at if you can sell pinot noir for to a ton how am i ever going to convince you to put gamay in and give to me for to so that challenges are not totally insurmountable but they re definitely elevated for sure so this is why you see people like hardy wallace follow him around he s all over the place we go to up to calaveras up to several different spots in the foothills we go up to mendocino we go down as far as chalone you re really driving to the places where things are more affordable and or you have a line on the growers who are willing to be a little bit different mason speaking of those growers when you buy these grapes are you purchasing them by weight or are you leasing by the acre how does that break down scott thus far everything for me has been in tonnage not by acre we have our dedicated areas and rows and there s definitely years like this year you ve probably heard from a lot of people a lot of the fruit hanging was heavier than normal which is usually great news they say oh we thought we were going to get you three tons and it turns out it s five phenomenal that s amazing i ll take it the two syrah vineyards we work with halkon and hawks butte those were planted by wells guthrie for copain originally i ve known the owner of the property for quite a while he also makes wine from the same vineyard of course when i was a buyer he was selling me wines and i was always a fan he tends to pick a little bit riper than even we do or than copain did but i was always a fan of the copain versions of those syrahs i joking said hey paul should syrah ever become available this is seven years ago jeez it s closer to ten years ago this was back when i was still in restaurants eventually copain walked away from halkon because they were on acreage contracts and their yields were so bad that when you do the math you end up paying something like a ton versus y know they backed out and he switched the format so we pay all just per ton we ve done everything to make it challenging for the consumer be it a name that people don t understand or varieties they ve never heard of like trousseau gris then they pour it and they re like what the this is such a weird color why is it like this image of release https imgur com zqpri b mason i wanted to ask about the white wines you make because trousseau gris pinot gris with a little bit of skin contact i don t know if everyone understands what that is or what that does to the wine so i m just wondering what you like about a little bit of skin contact as far as the wine s aromatics and texture scott that is the challenge when people ask me about the brand i ve done relatively everything to make it challenging for the consumer be it a name that people don t know what it means or how to say it or varieties they ve never heard of like trousseau gris then they pour it and they re like what the this is such a weird color why is it like this it s kind of all of the things the people who are savvy totally get it and are more interested just for the general masses it s definitely confusing there s plenty of wine that have a little bit of skin contact even things you don t associate it with like gruner then there s tons of ethereal completely skin fermented orange wines how it works with a lot of those in restaurant we tend to sit around and say oh man that s so interesting what should we pair this with where are we going to put it on our tasting menu because we want to expose people to it but it s such an application wine because of the texture and the tannin it s not something you want to drink a bottle of or several glasses of you want to have a taste of it with a certain dish and move along so i like the concept of skin contact i just want to barely tiptoe into it so that there s a little more breadth and palette and some visceral texture but not be so much that you all of a sudden have to break out cheese if you want to drink it quickly that s cool great but at the same time if you want to be a little more cerebral then there is that sort of mouthfeel and texture to think about they ask is this a ros or orange wine and i say it s technically neither it s a white wine with color but that s not really a category so you decide where to put it glass of windgap trousseau gris https imgur com nk mxqn mason yeah you re not making orange wine scott no definitely not that s the other confusion even when people are writing it on wine lists they say well where should i put this is it a rose or an orange wine and i say it s technically neither it s a white wine with color but that s not really a category so you decide where to put it mason a little side note i had a bottle of wind gap trousseau gris returned by a customer just based on the color they didn t even taste the wine which is shame because it s delicious i think we ended up drinking the wine ourselves but maybe these need some sort of explanation scott the first year we made wind gap trousseau gris i went into it with this idea of some skin contact and didn t know how much color it d take up at first back then we still used to share the same space with duncan and nathan from arnot roberts i was in there stepping on the grapes in bins and duncan looked at me and was like what are you doing is this a whole cluster cold soaking trousseau gris and i just put my arms up in the air and was like yeah i mean i think so seems like a good idea funnily enough i was just at a wedding this weekend and the kid who got married actually pulled out that very wine the trousseau gris which was funny to taste so many years later it was actually still very fresh i ve had the and that s not the case but the was still really intact after making that wine we put it in bottle let it sit for a while until finally it was the time to start actually putting it in the market we pulled the corks and tasted it it was a very bright kind of awkward peachy hue to it not something most people are familiar with you hinted at it in your question but it does totally change the texture and it really lifts the aromatics as well like completely different there s continuity when you taste the pax version and my version you recognize the characteristics of the variety but then they become so much different with the skin contact the first vintage we tasted the wine before we decided if we were actually going to sell this wine is it good do we think it s good and then we d try and be like shit i think that s really good but we didn t know we just thought it was good but we d made it but was it the ugly baby effect or was it really good so we d give it away and taste it with some friends and no no no that s legitimately delicious the confidence was born out of other people trying it i think the first year was two days on the skins we ve done and and gone as many as and then backed up again because we didn t like that as much so it s kind of different every year we ve more or less settled on the range and that s just depending on the pragmatics of the winery logistical stuff at that point it s just aqueous just sugar water there s no heat or alcohol yet so we re not really extracting much so if it s on the skins day and we re not pressing anything until the next day then we ll just wait the extra day mason i also wanted to ask about the gamay because i m pretty picky with gamay especially from places that are not beaujolais i wanted to ask you about the vineyard you work with for me i really like gamay that s made naturally and in very particular soils i was just wondering about your thoughts on the variety in california scott fortunately steve edmunds worked with ron mansfield a long time ago very specifically because of the soils up there so he convinced ron to go to beaujolais with him and then they came back and went up to the foothills where barsotti is so it more synonymous with the northern part of beaujolais you call it red but it s more like pink granite so there s higher iron levels which is pretty ideal i think steve is the one that recognised it so long ago but going up again with duncan and nathan and raj and looking around gamay being a variety i ve just always loved and being in california and looking around it was valdiguie which showed up more people would be like oh i ve got gamay and you d go visit the vineyard like frediani in calisota who actually just passed away and be like is this gamay or is this valdiguie and they d be no that s the same thing and i d say well no it s not the same it s actually quite different so steve edmunds i actually called him years ago and asked him if he would meet me he lives in berkeley so i drove down to berkeley and met c sar which is a couple of doors up from chez panisse told him how much i loved his gamay and i would love the opportunity if it ever aros to work with a little bit of it at the time he was the only one that was getting it and he pretty much just politely said no way we hung out a little bit longer i was bummed but i was excited to meet him so i walked him home and got in the car and was like ok maybe i won t get gamay we started looking in oregon for maybe people who would plant it and then ron started putting more in so duncan nathan and raj started taking quite a bit and i actually had to wait for about four years on the waiting list so that production was viable enough for me to take a little bit as well it s very interesting maybe you ve seen it or i m sure you ve read about it or one of the other guys has told you about it but ron does this funny thing where not typical in california as far as i know where it s a vertical headtrain not a headtrain like you d see in chateauneuf or something where it s low but also it s not on cordon it s head trained but it goes up so it spirals around so it s about as tall as i am or something so i was like ron explain this to me why do you farm it like this and the mansfields they have goldbud farms they grow all kinds of fruit wine grapes of course but all kinds of fruit nectarines and peaches and plums and he just looked at me and said well i m a fruit farmer i understand trees to me this makes sense all of the things you re trying to get out of vsp vertical shoot positioning it s facing the fruit out it s dappling sunlight and i was like ok wow this is fascinating this is not something that i ve ever seen before so he does quite a bit of that up there image of barsotti vineyard https imgur com vxadsqz mason i don t think i ve seen that yet i need to look that up scott also going into one of your other questions both duncan and nathan take from both vineyards barsotti and witters i only get the barsotti portion both are great but i m very content with that i m contiguous with duncan and nathan i m actually just beneath them underneath the hill so i m in a little bit of a cooler spot because airflow goes down they inspired it but we also we pay more per tonne than anyone else in the vineyard for ron not to spray roundup so we pay extra per tonne because you ve got to go in and hand hoe mason i think that s pretty important getting into the next question i don t like to throw the word natural around especially with winemakers because there s a lot of baggage and it doesn t really mean exactly the same thing to different people but i was wondering if you could talk about some of the techniques you use in the vineyard or maybe in the cellar from what i understand you re using wild yeast do a lot of foot treading and lower sulphur i mean these are not industrialized wine production techniques this is smaller maybe more natural style wine making would you agree with that or how would you characterize it scott i would completely agree with everything you ve just said the term is so grey area and it s becoming so cultish and confusing so i also try and stay away from it the first harvest i worked or the first several harvests was with a group called realm i was at the restaurant in yountville bouchon and everyone who came in tourism aside of course was in the wine business on some level be it christian moueix or the shafers some who were really great some people who were not really great but then winemakers viticulturalists cellar masters so then there was a few winemakers i was getting to know and wanted to follow along but it s tough to follow some of these guys like the andy erikson s and the thomas brown s they have like clients and they re all over the place so i met juan mercado who owns realm and he said yeah come on up to the winery it was the equivalent of what i d used to do in restaurants where you just kind of sign up and work for free and spend a couple of days or a couple of weeks i did that for the harvest i was still working at the restaurant but any free time i could spare i d just go to the winery that next year the post harvests they said we re in a grape phase do you want to be our cellar master so i became their first employee i was like jeez you guys are offering me a job but i don t really have any experience well don t worry about it we have a winemaker as long as you can listen and follow directions and execute your work orders then that s all we need they felt comfortable enough with me so i worked with them for a few years as their cellar master in napa it was pick it really ripe add a bunch of water and acid everything was inoculated new oak i was like ok this is as much of this world as i can handle i need to be more inspired and work for people who make wines that i like to drink image of scott and pax https imgur com pjsi tc it was definitely an introduction to what most people would call qualitative wine making taking a lot of care being very protective but at the same time it was very bombastic napa cabernet the people who love those wines definitely love those wines and they get hundred points scores but it was pick it really ripe saign e bunches it add a bunch of water which means you have to add a bunch of acid everything was inoculated new oak i did that for and and then came around and i was like ok this is as much of this world as i can handle i need to be more inspired and work for people who make wines that i like to drink and that s when i started to work more at duncan and nathan arnot roberts and brocway broc cellars and steve edmunds and all of these people that just weren t quite big enough to hire anyone i did a harvest with pax in i was back in napa on i was working with pax once i got to pax it was the shared space at pax brian glad and duncan nathan that disproved everything i was taught on the napa side nothing had to be inoculated they would brown their whites no stems were taken away they didn t really worry about a couple of leaves whereas in napa of course we had all this big fancy equipment and fourteen women on the sorting table taking every single piece of anything out of the ferment that wasn t a perfect ripe berry coming to pax we d jump in the bins step on it rotate it throw some dry ice on it and wait for it to start to ferment it was a very fast lesson i mean there s no right or wrong it s just whatever way you decide to go having worked with pax for so many years and you see it with all the same names duncan and ryan and now jamie the continuity or the ideology is similar across the board we all do things a little bit differently but i think that s just like cooking we could all try to make the same recipe from the same raw ingredients and the thumb print kind of comes out a little bit differently but it was a fascinating lesson to switch sides if you will so yeah in the cellar nothing is inoculated even if something gets stuck we don t have temperature control we stick things in the sun if we need to get them warm we re really not looking for big extractive temperatures anyway so we don t need to get things really hot it s really lo fi all the reds thus far have been whole cluster we just step on them we try to mitigate tannins in different ways because we like the flavour of the stems we just don t want to beat up the stems too much so we re just very gentle with them in the ferments mason and then use sulphur at the end scott that kind of depends on the wine and it depends on acid and ph of certain wines and or the va where it stands post primary we don t sulphur anything coming into the building unless it was needed like a year like where there s a lot of mold or rot or something then maybe you d have more to worry about but most of our stuff comes in really clean we generally hopefully get out to the vineyard and drop anything that shouldn t be coming in we re not really worried about a couple of leaves here and there it s not a big deal we just foot stomp everything let it run it s usually pumped down for the first half generally then we switch the pumps over just to be more gentle on the stems depending on the vintage our rooms are pretty cold so often malolactic doesn t complete until the spring which we re totally comfortable with usually things aren t getting sold until the spring after malo they usually get hit once then double checked once they go back up for bottling in the fall or call it end of summer usually we re bottling at the end of july in preparation for the next harvest which is also twofold we want to get a lot of preserved freshness so we like to bottle young but the other half of that is we also need those barrels back we re definitely restricted on space less time in barrel means less time to get stale less total sulphur going into the wine because we re not monitoring sulphur and continually adding sulphur mason besides the sulphur are there any other techniques you re using to mitigate va are you topping a lot scott for sure jaimee and i like to top more than pax and that s not one s better than the other i think we just have less experience so maybe we re a little more protective but she and i definitely tend to be in the two to three week turn a lot of people are in the kind of month or so turn we do a fair amount of carbonic pax does it a bunch on just about everything these days for gamay we start it we force in the carbonics for the first part and then we open it and step on it and let it sit whole cluster so it does have some time on the skins and stems so there s some extraction maybe one of the techniques that s possible different to some people is we often do use the piet d coup where we ll put for the gamay example we ll put it into whatever vessel it fits into whole we ll rotate it with a forklift or a shovel if we have to and then we ll take something else that s fermenting and it s usually something that s in that phase where it s about from lag to log where it s to in a range that s where we start ripping we put a gallon or two of that into the bottom of the fermenter so that there s something already fermenting and creating co so that as that sugar gets released there s something there to eat it otherwise we had found in years past that we kind of had this long waiting game at the beginning of this harvest we had ferments that didn t start for almost or days so putting grapes into a vessel and then sealing it with nothing happening that can lead to va volitile acidity so we wanted that kickstarter so we dip something into the vessel with the grapes throw some dry ice and co in there seal it then stick it out in the sun as it s releasing a little bit of sugar it s mixing with whatever was fermenting at the bottom and it really traps a bunch of co in there and it forces everything to ferment so depending on the weather there s no way to open it you kind of have to roll the bones depending on the weather outside if it s not that hot or it is hot we kind of open it in the five to seven day range and usually things are fermented about halfway or three quarters already in the berry they re kind of like boozy candies at this point there s a little bit of sugar but they re mostly alcohol the colour looks a little bit funny from that because we haven t crushed a lot of the skins so a lot of the fruit looks almost a little it greyed but then you step on it and it just releases the rest of the sugar and it just takes off it has so much heat and momentum and the sugar hasn t really been released yet so when you do it just it rips to dryness in a couple of days mason that s cool i met pax a couple of days ago and i asked him a lot of these same questions i ve been drinking his wine and the wind gap ones for a long time and i love them then this year i tried your syrah and was pretty blown away and the mondeuse from jaimee i also thought was amazing is there anything unusual you ve picked up from working with pax or is there anything you do different with syrah than some of the other producers that you ve mentioned that you ve learned from scott i think one of the things i ve definitely learned from pax that this carbonic game we ve been playing with he s obviously had way more wine to make over the years than i have so a lot of that experimentation was happening on his wines eventually we came to a point where we really liked the results and it s really a trip to see when you open a tank that s been lots of carbonic you wouldn t think there d be any colour but then the juice in the bottom of the tank is so vibrant i think technically scientifically you shift your ph and lose a little bit of that acid forcing things into carbonics but thee colour is so vibrant but then also working with syrah from colder sites it leaves us in a position when we re picking early at the colder sites so when we say pick early we mean pick early by brix level not necessarily by date being in a colder site we get more hang time we just don t balloon full of sugar generally that means we have a healthier ph a lower ph to leave all the stems in because obviously with all the potassium it shifts your ph up quite a bit with all the whole cluster if we re still finishing up at a ph and has all that bright violent aromatic with all the pepper and the things we adore about syrah not everyone loves that but we re headstrong and completely adore it so we keep doing it that way i think most people would probably say i m crazy but if the wine itself and the vineyard itself has that much character on its own adding all that oak just totally diminishes it mason that s what i think is amazing about your syrah it s what or alcohol scott yeah it depends on the year mason and then there s an intensity to them but there s also a sort of real sense of the varietal character and the terroir character that you don t get in a lot of new world wines or at least i don t from tasting a lot of syrah from california sometimes they re pretty oaked and pretty big some of them are really good but you don t get that i want to say old world but it s just a sense of place that you don t normally see it s amazing to taste your wines because i feel like you get that when you try them sorry that s not really a question more a comment scott well no that s amazing it s always great to hear or days ago we opened a bedrock from bien nacido obviously we re good buddies with those guys and i traded some wines with cody and he was like man you have to try this syrah this might be one of the most ringer syrah s we ve made in a while so we finally opened one the other day and the wine behind it is delicious i didn t even look to see what the alcohol was oh it s actually there you go but they re just in a more populous style where they like a little more oak and they re a little more gratuitous in that but like i said the wine behind that is so delicious and has so much character that it s definitely marred by oak i think most people would probably say i m crazy but the wine itself and the vineyard itself has that much character on its own adding all that oak just totally diminishes it halcon vineyard amp hawks butte halcon in particular is high elevation it s super rocky this really cultured soil we don t have to spray much sulphur in the vineyard at all because we re above the fog line and it s really windy there s all these great things about it that brining that it in and throwing a bunch of oak on it just doesn t make much sense the longer that i ve been working with pax on this side we ll have all the syrah s down and be putting stuff up to tank in like golden glens or sonoma coast or what have you and the three of us will be dipping into barrels and i ll be like shit this one s pretty oaky where s that from and we ll check the barrel to see what it is and it s like a it was a new barrel in and we ve used it ever since being so isolated from new oak all the time it really shows up a lot i guess we re sensitive to it mason speaking of amazing vineyards for syrah are there any other vineyards you re looking at in the future or maybe styles of wine sparkling wine do you make a rose scott being so small it was started just as me and it was all out of pocket my girlfriend we live together she s a winemaker on another property it would be totally unfair for me to say it s just me because it s totally not especially on the back end of things as we ve grown she s watched me get busier and busier over the years and she d say things like let s go to the beach or let s go here and i d be like honey i can t i have to be on the computer so she was like you need help and she just absorbed right into it and it wouldn t be here without her for sure that being said all of our because we re so small when people call me and it happens every year whether it s pax or myself hey there s some extra cab franc or hey there s some rielsing in henderson valley being some small and out of pocket you can t really just wildly jump into thins you have to be very conscious and concise in what you re going to take on they year we started making rose was where in everybody was coming up extremely short across the board and we were already taking a bunch from what we colloquially call buddah s in mendo where hardy and pax and michael cruse and everyone pulls a bit of stuff from there and that year i was so short on fruit there was some syrah decline some really old vines with syrah and it s literally like every th vine is still alive so what happens to that well you can have it if you want it ll probably be a tonne tonne and a half it s just so old and in bad shape and virused means it doesn t get very ripe we picked that and masked it with some carignan and made some rose out of it just to no be down a sku so that was the first year we made a rose kind of as a hail mary and there s all this old vine valdigui out there so the last three years we were like let s try valdigui for rose so we do make one but it wasn t really something we went in saying we need to make a rose it s just the fruit was there it was available and the fruit was good so we do it but there s so many other things like the gamay or the melon or the syrah not to say they have more purpose or poignancy or anything i m not sure what my point is we do make one it s just another sku in the system sparkling is most certainly something i want to play with but it s something i want to really understand and do correctly so i haven t done it yet we ve made a few p t nats from around the cellar over the years we never quite nail the grams per litre correctly they re either too gassy or not gassy enough sometimes pretty turgid and sometimes pretty reductive it s even things i ve talked to cruse about cruse makes sparkling wine for all kinds of people of course and he was like i ll do it for you but it s going to cost you a bunch of money and i was like no that s just not really the way i want to do it sparkling is something i d definitely like to do if i could afford it when it comes to drinking if i could just drink champagne all the time i would i love the searing acid i love all the soil and the mineral that to me is like all the time i love syrah and all those other things too but at a dinner party you almost have to remind me that red wine exists because i like light crispy anything that shows true soil or whether it s reduction and people call it true soil that s a confusing topic as well we re working with a couple of people it s tough to do when you re smaller but now that things are becoming more financially viable there s varieties that you re seeing more and more pax and jamie and raj are bringing more and more stuff over pax i m sure told you about the vineyard he just planted which has all kinds of cool things like gamay poulsard trousseau and some savagnin and mondeuse so more and more of that is happening sashi has kind of a library block of things they keep bringing back from europe there s other varieties that i like a lot we re working on getting some aligote cuttings from oregon and getting some into california the only stuff we really found here in california was really virused and you can t really move it around which is admittedly also true of the melon that we take the shelf life of that is probably not very long unfortunately it s amazing soils for the variety but it s too vigorous so we can t move it around and it s not very prolific the family that bought that vineyard two years ago they love having it there and they want to keep it there as long as they can but at the same time financially it doesn t make a lot of sense mason well awesome man i have a million more questions but i have to write this stuff down so i don t want to keep asking and have a bunch of stuff to transcribe thanks again for the time this was awesome scott my pleasure i m not sure if i said this in the email but paul s been on me to get out there in a good way not in a bad one my excuse before was having two jobs that didn t really afford me a lot of travel time because when you see pax in colorado and new york and la that s usually because i m in the cellar and he s not now that i technically don t work for pax anymore that also severed one income so i m not doing a whole bunch of travelling more just tipping away at and growing this that being said i think paul s working on getting me out there in the spring sometime mason the more wine you allocate the more we can sell paul does an amazing job and i m excited to get this on the list if you ever do come out we should definitely hang out you should come and check out the store scott i think we re working on it for the spring the only trips of course are new york and la are very important markets and that s where i sell the most wine i m from chicago so we re working on maybe doing a bounce in colorado on the way to chicago sort of trip mason well cool thanks again i ll send you this when i send it out through the mailer scott thanks man i appreciate the support it means a lot ends,masonba,1553621818.0,19,0
wine,b5ydeq,i recently had a sparkling wine that wowed me more than any other i recall having joseph perrier cuvee royale i was most impressed by the extremely luxurious almost foamy mouthfeel as opposed to stronger harsher bubbles and by what i thought was a very refined i e not too agressive and more complex and thoughtful flavor profile of cream love the cream and had never experienced it in sparkling wine before gentle lemon curd and yeast bread notes i d love to find more champagne and sparkling wines that showcase similar qualities but i m not sure why the above wine turned out the way it did are the characteristics i noted due more to how the wine was produced how long it aged on the lees in bottle aging the region the vintage the varietals used etc any guidance would be extremely appreciated,IAmPandaRock,1553650758.0,1,0

wine,b129ak,as far as i m aware the reasons for wine to be stored in temperature and humidity controlled rooms is to reduce the amount of the outside of the bottle becoming the inside of the bottle and vise versa so my question is this if we assume that the bottles are going to be impervious to the outside what reasons are there to store the wine at a specific temperature how does the temperature effect the evolution of esters etc in a vacuum would a higher than optimal temperature bias the reactions towards an undesirable profile or even a lower that optimal temperature would the complete isolation reduce the evolution of flavor compounds to unperceptable levels,Desolus77,1552580283.0,0,0

wine,b0wb5f,i m a winemaker in ca who currently buys organic grapes and uses it as a selling point but doesn t actually pay for the certification that says made from organic grapes on the label the cost and paperwork seem to outweigh the benefits but i m curious if anyone has some insight into this would this designation open new avenues for selling the wine what is the approximate cost to become certified per year i produce cases per year in the price range just to clarify this would not be the organic wine certification this certification is next to impossible to achieve at least with the grapes i work with as no sulfites are allowed whatsoever in the winemaking process on the other hand made from organic grapes allows a small amount of sulfites in winemaking as long as the grapes are farmed organically,rpg245,1552540078.0,1,0

wine,ayt57u,originally posted to r champagne but thought i might have more luck here hello the champagnes we have are moet rose imperial and laurent perrier la cuvee brut my husband and i were gifted these two bottles of champagne for our engagement last year we know nothing about champagne really although we do like it and thought we should save them for a special occasion thinking they ll improve with age it occurred to me today that this may not be the case perhaps we re better off drinking them soon with friends for an upcoming birthday i might be wrong but i m thinking it s not a given that champagne will improve with age a lot of it must be made to be consumed fairly soon after purchase rather than kept for years especially the mid range stuff which i think is what we ve got any thoughts gratefully received,josephinesylvester,1552067644.0,1,0

wine,awtzop,after a long time of personal effort i m pleased to announce that i ve completed the first version of the app i ve designed for android devices its name is wine routes and it is designed as a tool for all wine lovers the idea originally came up while i was looking to find out about the wineries in greece their products and their location unfortunately i found that the available data was inadequate and usually related to the popular wineries displayed on wine websites this was the case until i discovered a pdo pgi winemaking registry a simple excel file with no mechanical readability of this public information negating the possibility of being classified as open data so i proceeded to a mass processing of the data of this registry with the harder point of manually locating each winery separately it was a time consuming task but led to a total of nearly wineries with detailed data and geographic location the next thought was who needs this data who wants to know where each winery is located the answer was whoever wants to visit the wineries here lies the central idea of the application the winelover can browse the map explore the wineries and plan a winery visit route or follow a proposed route if he she has visited wineries he she can record his her view of them as well as save his her routes each route is designed based on an algorithm based on shortest distance or shorter duration the long term goal of the application is to promote wine tourism not only for the popular but for all wineries in greece giving the opportunity to show new winemakers as well as to promote the greek wine worldwide as the application is not only for greece but for all winelovers the app is officially released and available for free at https play google com store apps details id com phonegap wineroutes https play google com store apps details id com phonegap wineroutes more details can be found on the application s website at wineroutes eu http wineroutes eu i would be glad if you tried out the app and offered any advice remarks about the content who knows maybe it will expand to more countries,agristats,1551619670.0,8,0

wine,at7j6i,for an upcoming weekend menu i m looking to pair a nice bottle with three different meals in so far as possible as usual i m aware it is hard impossible to find a perfect pairing with these options especially since we cook relatively non standard but i d like to find something to carry us through no worries if it is sub optimal i m trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed they are chickpea lemon stuffed sweet potato http www asplashofvanilla com baked sweet potatoes with spicy lemon chickpeas possibly combined with a grilled eggplant egg in coconut tomato sauce http yummilyyours com egg drop curry possibly combined with some rice jackfruit burger http mygoodnesskitchen com easy creole jackfruit burger possibly combined with fennel pumpkin or zucchini fries what would you recommend we have a fairly varied cellar though some notable wines are lacking multiple suggestions both red and white if possible so we can select a good bottle my main thought was going out to a viognier a south african ridgeback since it is from and so should be drunk quickly and it might be medium and balanced enough to match all dishes what do you think,Kalenden,1550778535.0,1,0

wine,asu4ki,i m planning on doing some a wine tasting at my house with a few friends we ll probably have bottles of red wine but i only have decanter if i m supposed to decant multiple bottles but only have decanter what s the best way to ensure the wine has appropriately opened up without having to wait for the wine to decant every time we go to a new bottle i m thinking of double decanting pouring wine into the decanter waiting an hour or whatever then pouring the wine back into the bottle and recorking it the wine the night before or earlier in the morning for a brunch noon tasting i m thinking that this way the wine will already be decanted and ready to serve when the guests arrive is this a good idea or do i risk over oxidizing the wine or is there a better idea that i m not thinking of i m very new to this and i really appreciate you guys helping me out,IAmPandaRock,1550698597.0,1,0

wine,aoqxj0,boyfriend took me to a dinner for my birthday a couple years ago we get to the table do a cheers finish a glass of champagne he tells me to order a bottle of wine and steps out for a smoke as he leaves the sommelier comes to the table to help me pick out a nice red i was thinking that since the cheapest decent bottle was probably around the usd mark it wouldn t be greedy of me to keep my eye on a number around that bracket i didn t say a specific price range to the sommelier so when he ended up recommending one that was sure to hit the spot and it did i just went with the recommendation let me just say now that i have very terrible vision and even when i m wearing my contacts it s still just extremely bad i know i gotta get that checked out but onward with the story i skimmed over the menu s description just to confirm and of course checked the price all was well boyfriend came back wine came did a tasting it was very nice but i m a little shy to emote unless i m already a little tipsy but i confirmed to him basically like yes this is really nice and he was just basically like a re you sure yes very nice perfect neither boyfriend nor i even thought to take a picture of the bottle before the server poured the stuff into a decanter we were enjoying our dinner very much and at the end i went to the restroom and returned to see my boyfriend laughing his ass off he said you ordered it happened in japan so that would be roughly about usd wine i thought he was joking and i was laughing and just like wtf no are you joking he showed me the receipt and i went pale i missed an entire zero when i was reading the menu i was crying in the train on the way home feeling terrible to this day i don t know if his laugh was from genuine amusement or if he didn t know how else to react the thing that kills me the one i ll never be able to get over is i don t even have a photo of the bottle i don t remember its name it was easily the best red i ve tasted in a very good while or even ever probably i just can t get over it i m also just imagining the staff were probably thinking damn how special this girl think she is just because it s her bday waiting for her man to leave the table to order some good shit tldr ordered and drank a bottle of wine i thought was usd but in the price was an extra zero which i overlooked,Maynaise88,1549705237.0,54,0

wine,aoin2d,hi in short i found that i really like whites which are not too dry dry riesling or too sweet moscato not too tart sauv blanc and not overly floral pinot griggio chardonnay sometimes i am in mood for these but it depends on the meal however i recently tried a blend the day wines vin de day blanc http daywines orderport net product details day wines vin de days blanc which is listed as pinot blanc muller thurgau riesling pinot gris muscat and really liked how balanced it was not too sweet not too dry not too floral not too tart aside from this particular wine i found the closest way i could recreate this at home was by mixing an off dry riesling or other off dry german white with say a dash of dr loosen riesling which i find is a little too sweet if you follow what i m getting at can anyone recommend me whites that already have this type of profile i imagine it could well be a riesling with the right crisp balance or maybe a gewurtztraminer i ve certainly tasted some wines at the virginia wineries that are close to this and i have a friend who claims to have tried some burgundy chardonnays which fit this profile although i m skeptical the closest i found to this was macon villages thanks any input is appreciated,MorphineSmile,1549645786.0,1,0
