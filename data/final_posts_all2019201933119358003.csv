travel,b7owfp,"Hi Reddit! My friends and I will be going on our post-graduation trip to Korea, and would like to travel to Seoul, Jeju, and Busan in May.

What is the best/cheapest way to travel? Plane or train?

Also, when looking at flights, a lot of airlines have different types of fares (special, discount, normal, event), which fare usually includes checked baggage (we saw that Eastar only had two out of three fare types that included baggage, but Asiana airlines doesn't have this information explicitly on their site)?

Thanks for your help in advance! :)

travel,b7q4dz,"Hi all,

A friend and I are heading to Nepal from April 19 - May 7. Those are the dates we land in Kathmandu and fly off. We are planning on doing the Everest Base Camp Trek ourselves (no guide/porters), and we'd like to prepare as much beforehand prior to landing in Nepal so we can hit the ground running and begin the trek as soon as possible. We are aware that while possible in the timeframe we're in Nepal for, weather and altitude often make EBC trek times unpredictable. There were a few items we'd like clarified, and thank you very much in advanced!

1. **Flight to Lukla:** We'd like to book flights on April 21st as early in the day as possible to avoid any inclement weather. The most common ways of booking flights are through Nepalese agencies or online through the various airlines websites. When I go to the Yeti Airlines website, it says there are no flights available. Does anybody have experience booking flights either way, and if with an agency, could you recommend an agency in Nepal to book with?
2. **Return flight:** Would you recommend booking a return flight from Lukla to Kathmandu before hand, or waiting until you've returned from EBC and are more certain of when you'll be ready to fly back?
3. **Permits and TIMs card:** Similar with the flight, is it possible to book these prior to landing in Nepal and picking them up somewhere? We'd like to mitigate any time spent in Nepal getting this stuff in order so we can explore Kathmandu and fly to Lukla.
4. **Altitude medication:** Apparently it's possible to purchase altitude medication (i.e. Diamox alternatives) in Kathmandu. Does anybody have any experience with this?
5. **Other medication:** What other medication would you recommend bringing? Immodium, antibiotics and altitude medication are the three I've added to my list.
6. **Is a sleeping bag required?** We will be staying in teahouses, and while these can get chilly in the evenings (especially higher up), is a sleeping bag really needed? I believe the teahouses provide blankets and such.

travel,b7pvqi,"I will probably be back here with more specific questions later, but I thought that asking here would be a good place to start. I live in the Western U.S, I have a fair bit of money saved up, and my parents will help send me where I want to go. I love nature, especially backpacking/hiking. Right now, I am leaning towards two places: Southeastern Asia (Nepal, Vietnam, etc.) and Northern South America (Colombia, Ecuador). I think Asia could be cooler, but I also speak competent Spanish and so I might have an easier time in South America. I would likely go for 1-2 months, and I would like it for some of that time to be spent backpacking/hiking. I have traveled in other countries before (Peru, Mexico). I'm also not super interested in going to Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

So, does anyone have any recommendations for me? I'm mainly wondering where I should go and what I should do there. I few ideas I have right off the bat are:

* Biking Vietnam
* Trekking in Nepal/Tibet
* Backpacking in Colombia
* Just Traveling Around and Staying in Hostels Somewhere.
* Some kind of Volunteer Program

I know this is kind-of a big question, but I'm really just looking for some general recommendations.

Hey everyone! You guys have always helped me get the best itinerary possible so thank you for that! Now I’d love your assistance with my Australia itinerary. It seems pretty straight forward to me, we are doing the traditional Sydney/Rock/Reef tour. I know we are probably staying a little too long in Sydney, but we are an LGBT couple and from what I understand, Sydney is a great place to visit! The weather looks to be a bit cooler during late April/May, but should still be a pleasant time.

&amp;#x200B;

**SYDNEY**

Not sure which area we are staying in Sydney yet, if anyone has recommendations. We will probably stay in a hostel or Airbnb.

* Arrive April 21st in Sydney - arrive early morning, recover
* April 22 - Sydney
* April 23 - Sydney
* April 24 - Sydney
* April 25 - Sydney
* April 26 - Sydney

&amp;#x200B;

**ROCK**

We are doing the Rock tour - the cost isn’t that expensive and we are seeing everything we want without having to spend a fortune on accommodations and the hassle of doing everything ourselves.

* April 27 - Fly to Yulara (found an $80 flight, arrive in afternoon), begin Rock tour day 1 (Ayers Rock base walk, see cave paintings, sunset)
* April 28 - Rock tour day 2 (Sunrise over Ayers Rock, Kata Tjuta)
* April 29 - Rock tour day 3 (King’s Canyon, arrive in Alice Springs at night)

&amp;#x200B;

**REEF**

Staying at Gilligan’s hostel

* April 30 - Flight to Cairns ($390) **-** arrive in evening
* May 1 - Cairns 1
* May 2 - Cairns 2 - Great Barrier Reef tour with Silverswift (this seemed to be the best from my research)
* May 3 - Cairns 3
* May 4 - Fly back at 5pm

travel,b7kn5f,"Im about to head off to thailand for 10 days in about a month or two.
And i faced a deeper question.
Its a simple question really with a not so simple answer.
Should. I. Bring. A. Camera?

Well here is my 2 cents on the matter.

You see last time i went to thailand was 10 years ago. And smartphones wernt a thing then.
 I enjoyd the trip probebly 10864 times more then i enjoy trips today with my phone in my pocket at all times. 
I had a great dslr camera which took some amazing pictures, 
and yea it was a pain to carry but eventually i sattled down on a pocket sized camera that was also amazing. 

The thing is that with my samsung galaxy s8, or with my friends iphone xs, the picture quality that they can take is not less then amazing, i agree not as good as a good dslr camera or even not as good as some pocket size cameras, but its always with u, dont need to charge etc...

And here we face some of the issues with that.
You see when u have an external camera and your taking shots with it, there is a sense of i dont know how to explain it better then just say ""magic"" when you review the pictures.

You remember them. You go over each one deciding what to keep. 
It creates good memories

As where with the iphone you take a picture of anything becaouse its so avilable, and that magic i dont know if fades but get cluttered up in a digital mess of 2000 pictures,

Not to talk on the fact that you already have your phone out when u review the pictures so you might as well check gmail, fb, and other trip ruining, friendship reuining apps that take away from your expiriance of being in a trip with your loved ones having fun .

Its not so much of a ""vacation"", when your phone is out and your so availble like at home.

And then on the other hand
Not brining your phone means you let go of maps, ubber, and reservstion details on the fly.

Maybe its just an old man grunting on not being able to adept to this new world,

I think ill sattle down on buying a gopro for allot of video making, 
plus with my drone i can have some great video in the end, and ill minimize the pictures taken to a minimum. 
Maybd thats the sulotion for me. Hellci dont know..

- I am really interested in museums and history while my friend wants to go ""wherever"".

**Itinerary**

May 1st: Arrive at 6:35AM in London. Explore Hyde Park and Big Ben. Visit Buckingham Palace in the afternoon (is it worth it?)

May 2nd: National Gallery in the morning, Westminster Abbey in later in the afternoon and London Eye before sunset (quite expensive ticket. once again, is it worth it?)

May 3rd: British Museum for as long as we can and head over to Tower Bridge later. 

May 4th: Try walking around and exploring around Picadilly and Trafalgar? There are many free museums to kill time in. Take a 7:34 PM train to Brussels and arrive at 10:38 PM.

May 5th: Explore the city of Brussels around the Grand Palace. Indulge on chocolate, waffles, fries and beer.

May 6th: Day trip to Bruges using Go Pass 10. Any specific attractions we should go into or is a walk around town and maybe a canal boat ride enough?

May 7th: Day trip to Ghent using Go Pass 10. Same as Bruges. Any specific attractions?

May 8th: Take a train from Brussels to Paris and arrive at 10:33AM. I originally thought of doing a day trip to Antwerp but didn't see much that attracted me so added an extra day to Paris. Also the reason why I went London-&gt;Brussels instead of London-&gt;Paris is because Eurostar tickets to Paris around this time were crazy expensive. Anyways, arrive in Paris and head to Pont Neuf, Notre Dame and Jardin Luxembourg. Go up the Eiffel Tower in late afternoon.

May 9th: Activate a 48hour Museum Pass and visit the Versailles (which I missed out on the last time!). How many hours will I need there?

May 10th: Go up the Arc de Triomphe in the morning and come down Champs-Elisees to Pont Alexandre III and Place de Concorde. What would be the best use of the Museum Pass? I would love to visit Orsay or Louvre again for a few hours but have not visited Sainte-Chapelle or Pantheon. Take a train to Amsterdam at 6:19PM and arrive at 9:44PM.

May 11th: Anne Frank house, Royal Palace and canal boat ride. Anyone have experience with an I Amsterdam city card or the Holland pass? If so, how have you used them? Were they worth it?

May 12th: Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. Canal boat ride again?

May 13th: Heineken experience? Guided walking tours? If we purchase a pass, there are so many options for this day.

May 14th: Take a plane back home at 10:00AM but with a long layover in Vienna. I know there is a lot to see in Vienna, but with less than one full day, what is something we really have to do there? I am thinking of going around Old Vienna and getting peaks at the Rathaus, Opera House and St. Stephen's Cathedral. Maybe a visit to the Schonbrunn Palace if time permits (doubt it)?

May 15th: Take a plane back home for real this time at 10:40AM.

So that is London, Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, Paris, Amsterdam and Vienna in 14 days. A very short period of time but Paris had been visited before and Vienna is only a layover.

24th - Athens this night - Travel Agency quoted us the Athens La Strada, open to suggestions

25th - Flight out of Athens at 8:35 AM

 As far as Athens goes, I was thinking at least the Acropolis, Plaka, possibly Sounion for sunset, and maybe Delphi. Looking for recommendations on how best to fit this in, or change. Thanks /u/umakanimike for the suggestions through other posts.

We definitely like a more low key destination, and the food, beaches, with adventure and/or historical sites mixed in is our style. Small hikes, good views, snorkeling/swimming, exploring the city, etc. Not so much looking for the night life or the super touristy stuff. Although, we thought about visiting santorini just for the caldera views, and Instagram-ness. We have since nixed that idea due to budget and wanting to escape the tourist trap. We are hoping to stay in the $2200-$3200 range for non airfare and first hotel night costs.

I apologize for the rambled thoughts and wall of text, but I will try to collect my thoughts with a few questions below.

1. My biggest question is how helpful is booking through a travel agency? I have heard mixed reviews and it seems like I could book cheaper myself, I am just worried about ferries and taxis.
2. Leading to...Is booking ferries online reliable? 
3. Is 3 days at each of those islands too much? Should we make another night in Athens before we leave?
4. Do you think we need to rent a car during any of our stays? Athens for Delphi/Sounion, or is taxi/tour possible? Milos looks big also. I am from the US, would I need a my IDP?

We enjoy places with lake villages, castles, short hikes and any places with beautiful views of the Alps. I am flexible to include some places in my plan which suit our interests. We plan to avoid too crowded places and opt for quieter ones. 

Our starting and end point is Linz. I am also interested to stay one day in this beautiful cabin (https://dolomitenhuette.at/) but don't have much information at this stage. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you so much!

travel,b7cwnq,"Hey travellers,

I'm looking into booking a trip to Peru over the Christmas holidays. I've only ever been to Argentina in South America before, so my Peruvian knowledge is very limited. 

I'm still in the preliminary research phase, but would something like this be possible at all? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 1: Arrive in Lima from Canada**

**Day 2: Lima** 

**Day 3: Bus to Cusco (all day Hop on/off bus) and stay overnight in Cusco** 

**Day 4: Train to Machu Picchu, stay in Cusco or Sacred Valley or nearbyish**

**Day 5: Christmas day in Cusco or wherever we stay nearby that area**

**Day 6: Bus back to Lima**

**Day 7: Fly back to Canada**

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a very short trip and ideally I would spend 2-3 weeks there, but I'm trying to keep it within my leftover vacation days at work :( 

**Is it possible:**

* To do one day at Machu Picchu?
* Will things be open in Cusco on Christmas Day? Is there a Christmas celebration on that day? It's totally ok if not, just curious
* What's the altitude sickness situation in Cusco if you take the bus up (I think it's about an 18 hour ride with 2 stops in smaller cities)? Could it be manageable to stay overnight there?

I left shortly after arriving to get medicine and came back 20 minutes later to find two of my luggage locks broken. I had put my expensive goods in the lockbox but there weren’t luggage lockers in my dorm. I have confidence it isn’t anyone that was staying in the dorm with me but the hostel isn’t taking responsibility. Another woman effected left for a hotel and they still charged her for the next few nights of her reservation so I decided to stay, especially because I trusted the people in the room but they didn’t offer a different room or hostel in their company umbrella hostels. I asked for compensation just for my built in lock suitcase and I was told to email the manager two nights ago, never heard back and had to check about before ever getting a response. Has anyone experienced anything like this?  Does anyone have insite as to whether that may be covered by my travelers insurance?

He finally handed in his masters thesis yesterday and I sent off the paperwork for my ""career break"". We have at least two years to travel and I will still have a guaranteed job at the end but we're on the fence as to whether we'll actually come back or not. Anyway... Our plan is to leave at the end of September and fly into Auckland. We are buying our flights this week. We are hoping to stay in a hostel or airbnb for a few weeks, check in with friends and chill a bit, and buy a car or camper. Following that, we intend to alternate between wwoofing/helpx etc and camping, either from the car/van or in our tent.

We will go into cities and see the sights but our hobbies and interests lie in spending time outdoors.

Our wish list is:

1. We’re based in the US, so we’d be looking for somewhere that isn’t prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to fly to. 
2. We have 3 kids aged 9-14 that we would like to keep busy for 7+ days without having to leave the hotel grounds every day. They make friends easily and stay happy with a pool/beach, especially if there are any additional water attractions, like slides or fountains.
3. A room with a master bedroom (for us parents) and enough room for the three kids to sleep in beds. They can share beds if there’s a queen and a pullout sofa, but we’d need some combination like that for them to be comfortable so they sleep well. We don’t really need much more than this, but it’s also not always a given that the parents have a private room.
4. Within walking/shuttle distance of a food court, preferably with a public seating area. We like to eat together, but almost never at the same place. We also prefer to eat away from the resort since it gives us something objective to do with little effort or stress.
5. We’d like to be within walking/shuttle distance of a beach we can swim at in December, but that’s not critical.
6. We've never done all-inclusive, but are open if there are recommendations that fit our other goals.

AirHelp takes care of everything for us and asks for 25% of the compensation, if we receive it. However, Ryanair refused to pay, once again, even through them, and so AirHelp informed me that my complain was legit and they offered to go to court for another 25% of the possible compensation, which means 50% total of the compensation, which I accepted and authorized the AirHelp lawyers to act in my behalf. They also adverted me that it was possible that Ryanair would try to get in touch with me directly in order to offer me a smaller compensation, and that I should not reply to the email and forward it to AirHelp instead, in case that happened.   


Yesterday I did end up receiving an email from Ryanair offering me a compensation, but, instead  of a smaller one, as stated by AirHelp, they are offering the exact amount that I should be receiving. I think that Ryanair knows that they would lose in court and instead of dealing with AirHelp they probably prefer to pay me directly, possibly to decrease the success rate of AirHelp and decrease also the number of users using AirHelp.  (I think that it's probably easier for Ryanair to deal with us instead of the AirHelp lawyers, specially when refusing to give any compensation).   


So, what should I do? Should I accept the offer from Ryanair or forward the email to AirHelp, as they asked? Did the same thing happened to anyone? What happens if I accept the offer? Can AirHelp sue me for violationg the contract? My problem is that if I accept their offer, I receive 100% of the money, and if I choose to stay with AirHelp I'll only receive 50% of it.

- Cozumel Island Tour with scooters and maybe find an intro scuba class. (roughly how much time should I block off for this?)

- Day in Tulum, see some ruins, and go to Akumal for sea turtles. (should I block off the entire day for this?)

- ATV tour of Cenotes. (is a morning for this enough time, or is this a much shorter experience than I'm thinking?)

- Xenses Amusement Park worth the visit? I'm not sure if going solo will be as much fun.

Should I go for the full 4 days with this itinerary?

Plane tickets look to be around $300. I haven't committed to housing but I'll likely go from $100-$150 a night depending on where I decide to stay. I haven't looked up car rentals but don't expect it to exceed $100 for the duration. 

Budget has some flex but I'm looking to spend up to $1,000. Is that realistic? I'm not a big drinker and won't be spending a ton on alcohol. 

I haven't built out a map of good eats yet, but would love any suggestions!

Anything else obvious that I should make time for? I want to have some relax/beach time along with activities. Maybe I'm packing too much into 3-4 days?

travel,b6rkym,"My wife and I are traveling to Ireland for two weeks in July, and although I have a lot of travel under my belt, I don't have as strong a sense for what I want to see there as I might for other countries. The only thing set in stone is that we fly into Dublin and plan to spend a few days there first. We'll definitely rent a car. For pace, I don't think we necessarily want to be moving to a new hotel every night, but a mix of one-nighters and two-to-three nighters is ideal. I want to see a good bit of the country because I don't really plan on going to Ireland again (only so many vacations a man gets).

For itinerary, I've heard great things about the west coast: the Dingle peninsula and Ring of Kerry, for example. We probably want at least 3, but maybe more days of really nice day hikes (5-8 miles, but could do more, bring a light backpack, finish and drink a beer at the bar, time to shower and have a good dinner--either loop hikes or easy transportation back to the hotel/starting point). Skellig Michael seems cool unless people here say it's totally overrated. I love castles; my wife can probably handle a couple but not too many. Cute towns to wander through, of course. I'd also like to see the Cliffs of Moher, but I don't know how feasible it is to cover the entire west coast without stressing--this is our first vacation without the baby, so I know my wife will want to sleep in. I'd also like to do some distillery tour or whisky tasting that isn't Jameson. Good food is a must, and if there are some bars with great Irish/folk music, of course that.

I’ve only ever traveled state to state and it’s pretty simple, if you have multiple stops you get your bags at the final destination.

1. Is it the same way while traveling internationally? Will I get my them at the final destination or do I get them in between each country and have to individually check them at each country.

2. Will my bags be checked due to me not being a citizen of said countries? If so I’ll buy a lock and put it on after due to having very important work related materials that I can’t just put in my carry on. Would I be allowed to do this?

Day 1: Land in Paris in the morning. Take a cab to the hostel in Belleville. Take the train to see the eiffel tower/arc de triomphe/notre dame. Explore/eat around there, then come back to Belleville to go out to bars at night.

Day 2: Go to the Louvre early in the morning, get lunch somewhere in the Tuileries Gardens. Then either go back into the Louvre or continue to explore the area. At night, most likely will go out to bars in Belleville again.

Day 3: Take a train to Versailles to explore the gardens for free. Not sure what to do with the rest of this day. We'll take the night train at 8pm to Milan, then another 2 hour train to Genoa.

Day 4: Once we arrive in Genoa at 8am, we'll take a bus or cab to our hotel in Portofino. We found a cheap little hotel right by the beach. Spend the day walking around the town (not buying anything because we can't afford it haha) just taking photos, and then relaxing by the beach. 

Day 5: Another day just relaxing on the beach. At some point later we'll get a cab/bus to Rapallo and take the train to Pisa then Florence. We're not sure where we're staying there yet, but we'd like to maybe stay somewhere a bit outside the city that's still accessible by a cheap cab.

Day 6: We'd love to do a wine tour! Still trying to find the right one. At the end of the day we'll take the train to Rome and meet our friends at the hostel.

Day 7: Rome 

Day 8: Rome

Day 9: Spend the morning in Rome then take the train to Naples, then to our Air bnb in Sorrento

Day 10: Sorrento

Day 11: Sorrento

Day 12: Take the train to Pompeii, stay in in Air bnb there that night

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the last 5 years living and traveling around the world, it was a long time dream, a bit of a destiny. Spent countless hours in the past staring at maps and wondering what would it be to go here or there, so finally I packed my things and off I went. Years went by exploring our great world and one day I started feeling that it was enough, I had done as much traveling as I wanted, and it felt good to go back home.

So, I came back. It does feel good indeed to be here, having all the comforts and a small routine, I couldn't complain the slightest. Also I don't consider any traveling in the short/mid or even long term for now. But I can't help myself with this strange feeling of resuming my life. My brain can't get around the fact that this is it, I'm back now. I left, and now I'm back, as silly as it sounds. Something that was a dream and a lifegoal pursuit only a few years ago became already part of the past now.

I have a simple question (sorry if this has already been discussed).

In two weeks I have to take a flight since I'm moving out from my  country. They have the medication I need in the country of destination, but since I  will be a not resident for a while, it would be very difficult to get a specific receipt.

They are aerosol/spray creams contained in a can. This means that the can contains a minimum component of gas, and I know that this kind of things are not allowed.

The deal expired on Mar 26, 2019 for Toronto &gt; Japan for $682 which was perfect for me, with my plan aiming for flying 

in October between multi cities (Tokyo - Osaka - Seoul(Korea) - Osaka - Tokyo - Toronto)

and now the ticket prices are around $920, which I still think is much better than $1,100+. 

&amp;#x200B;

My initial plan was to go to Korea first(I have to attend a wedding) and the fly to Japan, travel there, then fly back to 

Canada. But now that the round-trip tickets from Toronto - Tokyo are cheaper, I'm thinking to fly back and forth between

Japan and Korea.

&amp;#x200B;

Because this is basically my first big-plan trip ever for about 2-3 weeks, I can't remove this thought of 

""But what if there's another deal!? It's like flipping $200! It's only March!""

I think it's stupid but I just have no experience.. and the only thing I can confirm is to check previous deals in the past 3-4 

years on the same site, and finding that there will probably no more deals left. And flying to Korea first doesn't seem like 

a good option anymore, I don't see any good deals in the past years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So here's the summary of my big concerns:**

\- What if another deal pops up? From now until whenever for my October plans? (I doubt it but can it?)

\- Making a Toronto - Tokyo round-trip seems to be the most reasonable so far, instead of flying to Korea, leave from Japan. Am I correct?

\- Is it THE time to purchase the ticket? I still have no idea how many months ahead I should purchase the tickets

The islands I'm considering are Antigua vs The Bahamas vs Curacao vs Grenada vs Guadeloupe vs Puerto Rico vs Saint Lucia.

I'm on the East coast (Georgia specifically). I'll most likely visit at least 3 this year. I've never flown before and no idea will I have flown before the trip. One of these trips will be with family and the other with friends. Meeting locals and new people is also a plus. The Bahamas interests me because of its beautiful waters and how easy it would take to get there but I feel like there might not be much to do unless I island hop which seems like that would add up considerably. I think staying on a resort for most of the trip sounds so dull. Guadeloupe seems like it would be a chance to practice my French but I don't know much about there. Curacao interests me because at first glance it doesn't seem to be a traditional Caribbean island and the IG accounts I follow who've lived there loved it. Puerto Rico seems like there would be a lot to do with the size of the island, it being a US territory and lots of english helps as well. And then I've heard tourist dollars there would really help. The other islands seem small enough that I could explore them on my own or with an excursion and that I could see most of the island in a short period.

TLDR: What are your experiences on Antigua, The Bahamas, Curacao, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico &amp; Saint Lucia ? How were the people, the beaches, the water, what did you do there and how did you like it ? Also specify whether you stayed in a rental, hotel, resort, or airbnb.

I plan on staying in Europe, travelling to Belgium first to stay with my good friend for 2-3 months and then exploring the rest of Europe, sometimes staying in hostels and sometimes with friends (I have friends in England and Austria, as well as possibly Italy for a week or so if I end up going down there).

I don't really have my own time limit set. I don't have plans for college yet, or a job to come back to (I'm going to be moving to a different city in Canada shortly before the vacation). Ideally I'd stay in Europe for around 6 months total. More or less. Yet I heard from my aunt who travels a lot that you can only stay within the EU for 3 months total at a time. I'm not sure if this is true or not but obviously a Visa would change that.

I'll need a job anyways so I figured why not get a couple jobs while I'm there. However, I'm not sure what I can do, or what my best options are in order to allow me flexibility to travel. There are some old threads on this but they're all years old. I feel like with all the recent EU changes it might be a good idea to ask in 2019.

We will be doing a Spanish language school in Mahon and would also like to do some snorkeling / beaching while we are there. We think we would like to stay closer to water activities and drive into Mahon for our language lessons in the mornings. I have done quite a few hours of research already but am conflicted about where the best place would be for us (all the pictures look beautiful, but internet reviews are mixed/unhelpful), so I am hoping to get some experienced input from the Reddit community. Here's what we are looking for:

1) A peaceful, quiet, small town or more rural area (but it needs to be livable, e.g., at least 1-3 places for Airbnb and food)

2) An ideal place would have places to stay within short walking distance of a place for snorkeling. We care more about the quality of the snorkeling than about a pretty beach, although having both would be cool. 

3) My friend has a physical disability that allows her to easily snorkel and swim but she cannot hike distances of more than a few blocks without pain (e.g., places with 150 steps or 2 km hikes to get to the water would probably not work for her). In general our walking needs to be kept to a minimum for her to have a good vacation. Also for this reason we really don't care about proximity of tourist sites or activities other than water stuff.

4) We are looking for a quiet, restful, easygoing vacation with as few other people around as possible. We are not partiers or drinkers, aren't interested in picking up men, and don't want to be at places with huge amounts of noisy tourists, small children, dirty sand, high rises and condos, etc (part of the reason why we decided on Menorca - because it looked like a place for quiet adults to go). Given the choice, we would rather have a ""less picturesque/less interesting/less active"" place to avoid the crowds.

5) Being from the western U.S., we are completely used to and willing to drive long distances to get places (i.e., we are willing to drive to Mahon from pretty much anywhere on the island, so suggest anything!)

Both of the options are serviced through [fjordtours.com](https://fjordtours.com) and take place over the same timespan.

The first would be a train from Oslo to Trondheim, and then a boat that goes from Trondheim to Bergen overnight. We were then planning on spending a few days in Bergen (and possibly a day in Trondheim as well) to do some activities.

The second option is trains and buses from Oslo to Alesund, then going from Alesund to Geiranger and spending the day there, returning Alesund and taking a boat from Alesund to Bergen.

The aspect that we're having a hard time figuring out is what we'll get to experience with either option. We were wanting to see some of the fjords while we were in Norway, and we're aware that Geiranger is a good spot for this. The thing we're having a hard time figuring out is if we're missing out big time taking the boat from Trondheim to Bergen and seeing the coast as opposed to being in Geiranger.

I hear there is some sort of pass you need in order to get access to the parks, specifically Grindelwald/ Cable car/ hiking/ overlook. What is the most worth seeing and what are the prices like?

travel,b6aody,"Looking for suggestions/opinions/feedback on our short list for our honeymoon, currently looking at any dates after September 4th. We have really wanted to do an overwater bungalow, unfortunately those are just out of our price range with the cheapest being 13K all the way up to 20K total.

I think we have a healthy budget (10K CAD) however value is of utmost importance in our decision. While we are willing to spend the entirety of the budget, whatever is more expensive needs to offer value for the difference in cost.

Short list is as follows in no particular order:

1. Secrets Silversands (Riviera Maya) - Over the Pool Cabana: We thought this offered a good middle ground to the overwater bungalow we originally wanted.

2. Excellence Playa Mujeres (Playa Mujeres) - Two Story Suite: Have heard great things about this resort and the room looks quite luxurious and private, especially the second floor with private pool.

3. Hotel Mousai (Puerto Vallarta) - Ultra Corner Suite: Have heard good things but really not a ton of reviews compared to others. Again, really like the room and look of the resort.

4. Unico 2087 - Estancia Suite (?) (Riviera Maya): Not positive on room choice but the hesitation for this resort stemmed from the lack of reviews and the rumours of a lot of the existing reviews to be fake/sponsored. Really liked this resort for the ""Unlimited Inclusions"" as we would like to do some amount of activities.

5. El Dorado Maroma - Palafitos Bungalow (Punta Maroma): This one barely made the short list due to the cost, however if we do see that the value is there it's possible that we would take this option.

Sandals resorts really didn't sell us based on the pictures of the room when compared to the resorts on our short list and the cost just seemed like we were paying for the brand more than anything else.

travel,b69j4z,"Hello everybody,

i need help for planning a road trip with my dad - because i am lost. 

It will take 14 days - visiting some relatives in the USA, Texas. 

Something like 40 miles north away from Houston, Texas - is where my relatives live. My dad suggested that the first day we just go to the relatives. And my relatives suggested we go together to San Antonio. My father already booked a car for 14 days. So it will be a road trip - he disliked my suggestions of flying to those places. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a rough sketch where we want to visit: Houston; relatives place; San Antonio; Dallas; Memphis; New Orleans.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i wonder, what's the best plan to do/ what to visit. As far as i researched on ""trip advisor"" and associated sites, the ""City Pass - Houston"" sounds good/value. Like would it make sense to get City Passes of all the major cities we are planning to visit. Like i get the Space Center is a must see etc. So the CityPass with the extras sounds ok for me. Does anyone have experience how long/time consuming the CityPass 5 places are...? like 2 or 3 days? or more less?

&amp;#x200B;

Why those cities? -&gt; 

Dallas: my father wants to see Basketball teams

San Antonio: trip with relatives

Memphis (Tupelo): my father wants to visit the place because of Elvis Presley 

New Orleans: a suggestion i gotten, because it's so much different from Texas. And i want to visit it.

travel,b6c1dl,"Hello, guys! How are you all doing? 

I'm kind of living a dillema and I need some help to decide what to do. 

The scenario goes like this: I'm a 24 years old Brazilian that have travelled abroad for the first time only last year (to my neighbor city Buenos Aires ♡). For this year vacations I'd like very much to visit my friend who lives in Cologne, Germany. This time, I would have to go alone because none of my friends have money or availability to go with me.
But I'm scared of it. 
Not only for the fact I'll be alone until I meet my friend where she lives but what might happen until I can get there. 
The information I have is that I don't need to get a Visa to enter the country but I have to prove what I'm going to do there, where I'm gonna stay, etc. It wouldn't be a problem because it's basically tourism, I have a permanent job here in Brazil, some savings and I'd be at my friend's house for part of the trip (I would eventually go to Berlin or Frankfurt and stay in a hotel). But what if I'm declined the entrance? I've known people who had everything right for their trip but still couldn't enter a country because immigration decided they couldn't. I mean, I understand the security issue and, of course, it's 100% correct, at the same time I'm scared that somehow I'd become part of a few percent that are denied access when the only intention is to meet somewhere new all by itself. I'd hate to create expectations about a trip, take a 11-hour flight (and connexions probably) just to be frustrated and have to return when I get there. Not even to mention the costs I would have for nothing if that happened. 
I don't know what to do. 
My vacations are in September and I need to decide as soon as possible however I cannot deny it's a possibility that will haunt me until they stamp my passport and say ""Welcome to Germany!"" (or whatever they say, I don't know). 
Does anyone have some suggestions on what should I do? I really wanna go there and live the experience still I'm afraid of everything going wrong.

2. (est 5 hrs) Zion National Park
3. (est 2 hrs) Mystic Springs (this would be used as sort of a home base to camp)

4. (est 2 hrs) Bryce Canyon
5. (est 30 min) Grand Staircase
6. (est 1 hr) Zebra Canyon
7. (est 1 hr) Capitol Reef
8. (est 1 hr) Goblin Valley
9. (est 2 hr) Canyonlands
10. (est 30 min) Arches 
11. (est 2 hrs) Gooseneck Can
12. (est 6 hrs) Dinosaur Monument
13. (est 2 hr) Unitas Mountains
14. (est 4 hrs) Salt Lake City (hopefully an area to rockhound for Agates or Jaspers)
15. (est 2 hrs) Antelope Island

  
With this in mind, I have not taken account of sleeping, eateries, and a great deal of camping spots on the way. I am not rigid in keeping to the script, so if this is unrealistic for 9 days or if you feel as if some of these places should be replaced with different spots I am interested!

We would really like to visit Merzouga, as well as the Atlas mountains, and we are having trouble fitting everything into our 7 day schedule. We thought we might save a bit of time if we did one of the 3 day 2 night tours to Merzouga which takes you through the Atlas mountains. We've done some research and it looks like all of these tours basically take you through the Atlas mountains stopping in Dades for the night, then on to Merzouga the next day. Has anyone done one of these tours, and if so, do you feel like you got enough of an experience of the Atlas mountains in particular? Or would we be better off doing a separate Atlas mountains tour, if this is a much more valuable experience? Any insight is really appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

so I will be spending two weeks in Georgia with my girlfriend this upcoming August. I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me some advice on my itinerary. Is there anything you would do differently? Something that I missed out on? Of course I did my research (reddit, caucasus-trekking etc.) but there might still be something that I missed. Thank you in advance!

As you will see, we like hiking and exploring nature with a bit of city exploring, too. Since we're going in August, is it possible to bathe in a lake somewhere along our way? Any recommendations?

* **Day 1:** Arrive at Kopitnari Airport. Transfer to Kutaissi and spend the rest of the day there as well as the night.
* **Day 2:** Marshrutka to Mestia
* **Day 3 + 4 + 5 + 6:** Hike from Mestia to Ushguli
* **Day 7:** Day hike from Ushguli to Chvelpi through Latpari pass

travel,b5wt9q,"I'm fairly new to travelling and this will be my first solo trip that's more than a few days so I'm a little nervous and overwhelmed from researching and would really appreciate some advice. I'm flying from Edinburgh. The timing is flexible (I can extend to 3 weeks) and I haven't booked anything yet. The original plan was Porto--&gt; Lisbon--&gt;Seville--&gt;Madrid--&gt;Barcelona. I'm now thinking that this would be a bad idea as it would result in me being in Barcelona around Easter which I'm worried would be far too crowded for my liking (I know wherever I am on Easter will probably be crowded but I imagine less so than Barcelona)

Current tentative plan is:

 

April 10 Barcelona

April 11 Barcelona

April 12 Barcelona

April 13 Barcelona

April 14 Early bus/train from Barcelona--Madrid

April 15 Madrid

April 16 Madrid--day trip to Toledo

April 17 Madrid--Porto

April 18 Porto

April 19-Porto-Lisbon

April 20 Lisbon

April 21 Lisbon-day trip to Sintra

April 22 Lisbon--Seville (I don't know if this is a good idea on Easter Monday)

April 23 Seville 

April 24 Seville-- ....

And then maybe a day or two in Granada and/or Cordoba 

I'm also considering visiting Ronda and then flying out of Malaga

Barcelona is the cheapest to fly in and out of but I imagine that the cost of getting back to Barcelona would outweigh the difference

Seville and Malaga are both around 30-40 pounds cheaper to fly out of then Porto or Lisbon so that's why it's ordered that way. Is it dumb to go in and out of Spain? Would it make more sense to do Barcelona--&gt; Madrid--&gt;Seville (+ other places in Andalucia) and then Lisbon --&gt; Portugal and fly out of Portugal? The flight out of Porto is around double the price of flying out of Malaga or Seville

I'm mildly interested in seeing an Easter procession (I know these are best in Seville) but would like to avoid crazy crowds. 

The only places in the itinerary that are must-sees for me are Barcelona, Porto, and Lisbon--the rest I am flexible on. I am debating scrapping Madrid entirely as my understanding is that it is mainly museums and those don't really appeal to me. I am, however, a young solo traveler who is interested in the nightlife + I know I would enjoy Toledo so it's still on the itinerary. 

Also--any recommendations for fun, social hostels in any of these locations. I'm new to travelling on my own and would like to meet people.

Would take any advice/recommendations that y'all could give me. I am mainly interested in beautiful architecture, wandering around old areas, and experiencing the culture. Museums and most paid tourist attractions don't really appeal to me (although I will pay to see Gaudi's work in Barcelona as that looks amazing) I tend to walk 30km a day while travelling and my style is to just walk in the direction of the prettiest building I see and wander from there. I also would like to meet people and enjoy the nightlife. My expenses are flexible but cheaper is better and I'm okay with long bus rides if that means saving money.

Anyway, thoughts on any of these things would be much appreciated. I'm feeling a tad overwhelmed planning on my own but am really excited to explore more of the world! Thanks in advance :)",2 Weeks in Spain &amp; Portugal--Would love some advice,majesticmile,1553642070.0,2,0

**Dec 29 - Jan 2:** Stay 4 nights in Bangkok  

**Jan 2:**  Flight to Krabi    

**Jan 2-6:** Stay 4 nights in Ao Nang   

**Jan 6:** Flight to Chiang Mai  

**Jan 6-11:** Stay 5 nights in Chiang Mai  

**Jan 11:** Fly home from Chiang Mai, arrive home on Jan 12

- Visit Grand Palace, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun  
- Visit Khaosan Road  
- Visit/go to the top of King Power MahaNakhon

- Island hop  
- Visit Ko Phi Phi  
- Visit Railey  
- Visit the Emerald Pool  
- Snorkeling    
- Day trip to Khao Sok national park (I know this is probably unrealistic or impossible but would absolutely love to visit here)

- Thai cooking class   
- Day trip to Pai

- Ziplining  
- Kayaking  
- Some short/mild hiking or trekking  
- See some cool waterfalls

Going to be 40 this year, and have been dreaming about this trip for over 20 years. Finally applied for my passport, and we have flats picked out in London and Paris. We know what we want to do, so no, AutoModerator, we aren't looking for advice for London or Paris.

My hangup is the flight.

I haven't flown much in my life, less than ten total flights. I have a bit of a height issue (I wouldn't call it fear), and I don't like not being in control. The safety record is well known to me, but still it persists. There's two areas that I could use some advice/feedback on.

**Comfort:** It takes a perfect scenario for me to get to sleep. I am a stomach sleeper, as much as I've tried to change that. I doubt I will be getting much sleep sitting up in a cramped seat, but I am trying out ANC headphones, pillows, etc now to see what might assist. I am of average height, so legroom isn't a huge deal. I'm not thin, but I also don't come close to overflowing  the confines of my seat. The more I can't fall asleep, the more anxious I get about falling asleep and it cascades. All the flights from Atlanta to London are overnight, which works for our itinerary, but I'm worried I will be a mess trying to function even until dinner time. The only other overnight flight I've taken was from SFO-ATL, and I slept perhaps thirty minutes. It wasn't very fun.

**Cost:**The above dovetails into price. I can find RT tix ATL-LHR for about $650 ($1300 for both of us) in lowest level economy via a third party off Skyscanner. Now, I've seen plenty of advice that says to book with the airline, but that bumps it up to $890pp. I could then upgrade off that if I care to. Premium Economy is running roughly double my original $650pp ticket. Is some more legroom worth double? Is being able to select your seat worth $110? We're hoping to travel light, just a carry on bag for us each.

I just have no frame of reference to know if the $650pp deal is good, to not buy third party, and if it's worth double to change from Economy Basic to Premium Economy (the carrier I am basing all this off of is BA, but it seems to be the same for Delta, et al). Since we've never really traveled, we have no loyalty, points, or anything other than currency to use. We hope this is the beginning of the second half of our lives traveling more, but we are starting basically from scratch.

travel,b5tyct,"I (31year old female) am set to travel to Thailand/Singapore in May for 1 week. I was wondering what type of medical insurance i should get (if i can even get any). I was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst last july 2018 but it has been stable and no changes to management plans/or to cyst itself/watch conservatively for need for surgery/no symptoms. The last appointment with the doctor was Feb 25 2019.

My question is, is this a pre-existing condition (my guess is yes) and if so, would i get any type of coverage at all? I heard in some cases there are ""pre existing condition waivers"". Do these exist?

The only case i can think of where it would become emergency is that if the cyst twists on the ovary itself and then it would become emergency to untwist the organ. I've had this cyst apparently for years so I don't anticipate anything bad happening but... you never know.

- both big wine drinkers
- eating seafood and pasta (maybe cooking classes?)
- Mediterranean beaches
- Great scenery/hiking
- water related activities (scuba/snorkeling, jet skis, parasailing, etc.)

travel,b5w57o,"I'm not the one directly effected but i'm posting on their behalf:

Some friends of mine in college (they're kenyan nationals studying in the usa, i'm an american born citizen) planned a decent ahead for a trip to paris/barcelona during spring break (march 25th to 29th for them) and got all their ducks in a row, mostly importantly **they started the visa application process for france very early** (14 days before the flight, when the visa people themselves said they only need ""at least"" 5 days). In particular the visa agent completely failed to request any kind of health insurance information initially, didn't mention it, then several days later came back saying it was required, which delayed the process by a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**The flight was supposed to be YESTERDAY and the visas STILL have not arrived**, and my friends can't even get any worthwhile information on when they'll get their passports back, they're being held hostage. So they essentially cannot leave the country.

&amp;#x200B;

So, me thinking ahead while booking tickets before all this visa situation happened, i saw an ad for **trip mate travel insurance**, thinking it was comprehensive since on the website where we bought the tickets stated ""covers cancellation for any reason"", turns out any reason is pretty rare circumstances such as serious injury or a terrorist attack. Trip mate has a long list of people with very legitimate claims being denied for various bullshit reasons. Visas being held hostage isn't even considered claimable. Student universe just directs them to trip mate so they're not useful

&amp;#x200B;

**is there any avenue by which they can plead to someone's humanity to get some (let alone all) of their money back? Even flight credits?** Like, should they contact the airline directly? Try to talk to a higher up at trip mate? Insist on student universe? They were saving up for many months for this trip, but now they're out a trip and out $466 per person because of some shitty visa processing.

They booked a westjet vacation via a travel agent. They asked for it to be a 4 star, all inclusive, and in the beach of Puerto Vallarta. As they have never been to PV, they relied on the expertise of the agent booking the vacation. They ended up at the Krystal resort. Apparently, it was not only old and dilapidated but dirty and disgusting. There was garbage on the beach, exposed wiring throughout the resort, and staff that seemed unwilling or unable to address their concerns (of which there were many). Some other examples of issues: The pools were unlit and scummy, there were dirty dishes in the hallway that were never taken away, they didn’t have hot water in the room until day 3, which sporadically seemed to fix itself, the only clean water that was provided were two small water bottles in the otherwise empty room fridge.

Now, I have to state that my in-laws are genuinely nice people that will make the best out of any situation. However, when feeling unsafe and unheard, it is understandable that they feel as though their trip should be refunded in some way. 

So, they have contacted the travel agent and Westjet. They both insist this resort was 4 star, and therefore it is not their fault there were issues. Westjet offered $400 compensation to be used on another vacation. On a $4000 trip, that seems like a slap in the face. 

My question is: has anyone has this experience with Westjet and if so how can they get a full refund, or at least better compensation to feel as though the trip wasn’t completely wasted.",Westjet help! Nightmare vacation,kboxy,1553619061.0,0,0

For accomadation I booked an apartment in the city centre via booking.com. The price was about £1,100 Euro for the 4 nights and I paid via credit card. This was a no cancellations allowed booking.

Soon after booking I was messaged by the host via booking.coms messaging system, giving me the exact address and asking to arrange a check in time. The message also mentioned that I could pay the €500 damage deposit in cash deposit to the person who checks me in.

Wtf... I never agreed to this deposit I thought.

I scoured the apartments listing on the website, and finally, right down the bottom of the page, far far below the button I actually clicked to book (about 4 screen worths down) I see mention of a damage deposit.

I’ve occasionally booked places that have a deposit before via Airbnb, but in that case the website handles that, and will take the deposit amount from you if you trashed the place. I’d have no problem with this if booking.com handled the deposit and I could pay via credit card (where I’m somewhat protected). Handing over €500 cash seems like a good way to get scammed though. Never done it before. I don’t even really want to withdraw that much from the bank, just to have to convert it and then put it back in the bank later.

Some preface. I'm a professional opera singer and lover of classical music just graduating from conservatory. I'm 21, male, I have an American passport, am 21 years old, and speak English and conversational Italian. 


June 10th - July 20th: I will be residing in [Novafeltria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novafeltria), Italy, a tiny town with a population of around 7,500 people. I am there on account of an American pre-professional program, where I'll perform in 2 fully staged operas. Room and Board are all paid for, and I have weekends off to explore. I will be taking 15 hours of Italian per week (included in the program) and I plan to spend a week and a half in Italy before traveling to my next location.

Additionally, I am in the process of securing a $3,500 (EU 3100) Research grant to build on my studies in Italy. After I am finished performing there, I plan to travel up Italy and eventually end up in Berlin, where the rest of my research will take place.

My tentative itinerary is as plan as such is as follows. (All travel most likely be by rail, and I will be staying in hostels)

July 21st. Bus to ROME
July 27th. Rail to FLORENCE
July 31st - Rail to BERLIN. Arrive morning of August 1st.

For the rest of my summer, my time will spent in Berlin. The only requirement is that I spend 40 hours a week involved in independent research, which centers upon German operetta/cabaret from the 1900's-1930's

QUESTIONS!

Is there anywhere you all recommend going besides Florence and Rome? what are some of the undiscovered gems of central Italy? Novafeltria is also close to Bologna and San Marino as well, and I was wondering if there's anywhere better to spend my time than the big tourist destinations

I have never travelled solo before. I have been to the UK, Scotland, Belize, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica before, but they were all with friends, family, or school. What has your experience been with solo travel in Germany and Italy?

I essentially plan to stay in Berlin until my EU 3100 runs out. Do you think Berlin would be the best city in which to stay? Berlin was my first choice, But I considered Paris, Barcelona, Munich, Vienna, Krakow, and Zürich as well for their musical history around the turn of the century.

Is backpacking a thing in Germany? Johann Sebastian Bach is my absolute favorite musician, and I would love to recreate the [250 mile journey](https://bachtrack.com/feature-at-home-guide-bach-buxtehude-lubeck-arnstadt-august-2017) he took from Arnstadt to Lübeck when he was 20!

Going to Cambodia for a trip with my girlfriend for about 2 1/2 weeks! Have a few questions from those who have done so! 

Right now, we think that 17 days is pretty long so we kinda want to spread it out evenly to get the full experience. Here’s my thoughts so far:

* 1. Land in Phnom Penh, spend 2 days(?) there to visit the museums. Is this enough time? I hear you don’t need to spend much time here. 



* 2. Head to Siem Reap (by plane? By bus? Which is better for the experience?/safety)



* 3. Spend 5? Days there and visit the temples / pub street / markets



* 4. Head to batambang for a day or so? I figure there’s a way to get there from siem reap and it can be a 1 day trip. 




* 5. This is where I kinda get muddled. We want to also go to tropical areas like beaches, so I was thinking Koh Rong? If so how many days would be good? Any other islands / beach relaxing areas you guys would recommend?




I feel like even after this we have plenty of days left. Planning on maybe flying to Chiang Mai for like 3 days as well.

So as the title says, I’m a first time flyer and I’m planning a trip to Ireland from the U.S.
I have a lot of questions and most of them can be answered by a simple google search, however, there is one question that I’m hung up on and can’t seem to get past or even get answered.

With Brexit being the total mess that it is and personal situations, booking a flight is becoming a challenge. I’ve got my time frame worked out (End of May, so almost 2 months out) but most flights I see that fit the time frame I need, and price, still show the Boeing 737 MAX-8 as Interstate flights to larger airports (I’m coming from Tulsa, Oklahoma). And just about every single one is non-refundable unless it’s within 24 hours.
So being that I’ve never flown anywhere or had to deal with airlines, I have no idea how cancellations work. 
If something happens and I decide (not the airline) that situations become unsafe and that I don’t want to put my family in any danger or my personal situations don’t allow me to travel, is there any way to cancel or would I just be out all of the money that I would spend on the tickets and the airline would just sell someone else the tickets? Or could I cancel within 7 days or something and be refunded at least partially? If I didn’t state anything clear enough I’d be happy to discuss and clarify anything that needs cleared up.

TL;DR - I guess I don’t understand cancellation policies. I’m planning a trip 2 months out but don’t want to spend $3,000+ dollars on airline tickets I can’t use if I’m unable to go. Is a cancellation and refund possible after 24 hours without death?

Edit: So I’ve realized that I’m overlooking and overthinking what’s black and white. I’ve got a combination of first time traveling abroad jitters, first time flying jitters all in one (which is no excuse) and basically I’m overthinking everything. I just need to stick to my window and go.

My first trip was 3 weeks and i ended up staying in Narita, because it was 900$ including a free breakfast each day and i couldn't pass up the savings, but after a while the commute via shuttling back to the airport and taking the airport bullet train into downtown tokyo was taxing, wasting up to 2 hrs each day of exploring time and forcing me back before 6pm or being stranded from my hotel. It was a good exploratory trip but i definitely missed a lot, and want to correct that the next time around.

I am very much a ""home baser"" when it comes to traveling. I need a safe, secure and above all else \*private\* place to be able to return to, but this time I want to see how having that home base in Tokyo would work out time and cost wise. I've always considered Sakura Hotel as the best option as recommended by other traveling friends, but with the rising popularity of AirBnB, i was wondering if people had good experience using it in Japan. As long as it isn't a group hostel, I'd be comfortable with most room types, such as apartment or a whole private house, as long as it was somewhat central.

After lodging, when to go is the next concern. The friends who want to go with me are really insistent in going to Comiket, which has us in either August or late December. I am not a fan of summer traveling(Because greater than 30C is no bueno for me) so It looks like they are set on December barring me convincing them to forgo Comiket for something else. I'm wondering what kinds of festivals or unique events happen in late December Early January in Japan that might be good to see, or other ""Must See'' events that happen more in the fall or spring that might convince them to consider over Comiket. We are all big foodies, so big food related events would be an easy sell, or events that have really interesting seasonal fare. Anything with food, really.

I don't mind the latter, I just want to make sure that if I buy this ticket, I'll be allowed onto the train regardless of how full it is. Isn't that the point of the ticket anyways?

My partner and I are traveling to Scotland mid May as the title states.

We’ve decided to start in Edinburgh, spend a few days there (I’ve heard even a week there isn’t enough), and then rent a camper van traveling north and then back down south to Glasgow or Edinburgh over the course of a week give or take a couple days.

Basically I’m wondering if anyone has had good/bad experiences with different camper van rental companies including prices etc.

Hey guys. My BF's birthday is in July, but since his favorite band is playing in Chicago in May, I've decided to plan a trip to Chicago for him as an early birthday present. We're from the Detroit area, so we're probably just going to drive to save cash. I've been to Chicago but only once and on a school trip (I don't leave the state much) so I'm not familiar at all with the area, how parking works, must-see attractions/places, etc. Here are just a few of my questions:

1. How much is a reasonable amount for parking? Here we're used to around a $10 flat rate at the most, but I'm sure in Chicago it's much more expensive. I've done a little bit of Chicago research and seen $18/day flat rates, as well as $30/day flat rates. What's reasonable, and what's too much?
2. How much is a reasonable amount for hotel/lodging? I found a hotel (W Chicago Lakeshore?) on a list of ""best Chicago hotels on a budget"" and for two nights it looks like it would be around $290 or so per person. It's a really nice looking hotel, some of the rooms have a beautiful view of Lake Michigan, and it's less than 15 minutes away from where the band is playing. Is this too much for a hotel in Chicago, or is it a good amount considering the quality/convenience? (Context: we're two college students who aren't broke by any means but we can't spend $400-$500 per night on a hotel) 
3. Since we'll be going in May, what are the best things to do considering the weather/season? Any must-go/must-see places? Restaurants/food places we absolutely must eat at? BF and I love going places with nice scenery, like flowers or gardens. Any cool art or science museums? Bookstores? We're big gamers, are there any arcades or anything like that?
4. Aside from hotel fees, what is a good budget for the weekend? We'd probably get there Friday afternoon or so and leave Sunday. Since I don't know how much more expensive food/services is in Chicago, I'm really not quite sure where to start. 

Sorry for all the questions; I'm a huge planner so I really want to be sure I've got this all figured out. If anyone has any advice or recommendations, please let me know!!",Planning a surprise trip to Chicago for BF- recommendations/advice please!,usagikaychan,1553529485.0,1,0

travel,b5btn2,"Hi! My family and I (parents in 50s, kids in late teens/twenties) are heading to Norway in July and have 3 days to spend in between Stavanger and Bergen. I know this is a pretty short amount of time so I’d love to get feedback on our itinerary! For context, we're pretty active/outdoorsy and are used to driving long stretches of road (in the United States, we've driven from New York to Florida 4 times, once from New York to New Orleans, we've done tons of vacations centered around driving long distances + hiking) but I am recovering from a hip injury so we may have to be a bit less intense than usual.

Here is [a google map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dujJf5O5sWXXaHJP-CMIbM_jtm77Zr6A&amp;usp=sharing) that I've used to plot out some points for our planned route. I know right now 520 is closed between Hellandsbygd and Hara so the map is telling us to take a huge detour through points C and D, but in the summer we can drive that way directly. 

**Day 1:**

* Arrive in Stavanger early morning, by overnight train from Oslo
* Pick up rental car
* Drive to + hike Pulpit Rock (done by 3:00 PM/15:00?)
* Drive north, stopping by waterfalls along the way (e.g. Svandalsfossen, Latefossen)
* Stay in Odda

**Day 2:**

* Drive to Fonna Ski Glacier Resort, do glacier hike with Folgefonni Breførarlag (done by 4:30 PM/16:30)
* Continue north and east, drive towards Mabodalen Valley, Hardangervidda
* Stay anywhere near/between Kinsarvik and Eidfjord (or east of that)

**Day 3:** 

* Drive towards Bergen
* If time permits, hang out in Bergen
* Flight out of Bergen around 10:00 PM/22:00

**Questions:**

1. Overall, is this itinerary doable? We're hoping to take advantage of the long stretches of daylight in July to start as early as possible in the mornings and/or drive late into evenings, but I know this might seem ambitious.
2. General tips for driving in Norway? Multiple people in our family are comfortable driving through mountain roads/at night, but we've only driven in the U.S. so we don't know if there's anything particular to look out for in Norway.
3. How long do we need to spend at stops along the route, for example at the waterfalls? It seems like these waterfalls are pretty accessible and don't need a lot of hiking/time, but I'm not sure.
4. Has anyone done a glacier hike with Folgefonni Breførarlag? How was your experience? Was it worth the money? Are there options do slightly easier routes, in case my hip isn't feeling too well?
5. Are there other hiking options around day 2 or day 3 of this route that are moderate? (e.g. I don't think we have time for Trolltunga, so something shorter/easier than that would be great!)
6. If we have maybe 2-3 hours in Bergen, what would you suggest we do? We'll have our rental car, and are open to anything more outdoorsy, or also anything more in the city. We want to be at BGO by or before 8:00 PM/20:00.

Luckily I was quick to react, yelling “get the fuck back here” as I chased a second man with my bag down the stairs. I was steps behind him and fortunately enough he dropped my bag without a struggle. The bag was about 25 pounds, pretty heavy as I had multiple cameras and my laptop in there. I was lucky to have caught the scheme so early. Beware of any distractions, always hold onto your stuff. I was fatigued from travel and tired from holding a heavy bag for so long.

travel,b559on,"I'm afraid this'll be a bit of a story and a lot of explaining to do, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to thoroughly read this!

I am a 19-year old Venezuelan girl going through the cumbersome process of obtaining a long-term visa to study in a Spanish university. So far, the bureaucracy has been painful but manageable. I graduated from an American school, but I am currently living with my aunt and uncle in Venezuela, as my family (both of my parents and younger brother) are currently living in the United States. Of course, I can only apply for the visa in my country of birth, so I'm doing all the paperwork and process practically alone, from Venezuela. 

Even though it's a bit of a burden with all the political issues we have going on here, it has not been impossible. 

... But. 


I have one issue going on that has made me lose quite a few hours of sleep. I don't know if this might result in the waste of all of my effort, time, and money in the past few months. I'm scared. Here goes the story:


Almost two years ago, in 2017, I graduated from high school and had to take an unsolicited, unchosen, basically obligatory gap year. I wanted to go to university right away, and was even accepted to a hard-to-get-into university in Venezuela. However, we all then realised that since I did not hold a Venezuelan diploma (as mine is American), I was not allowed to actually attend the university. I had to do a ""legalisation"" of my diploma which would take 2 (two) years. I was devastated, since I was really looking forward to studying there, I'm a good student, and I worked very hard to get the grades I got. I couldn't study in America either because it is way too expensive. At that time, we could not even afford to pay the SAT, let alone American university applications. 


So after graduating and not being able to study, I was recommended that being an Au Pair might be a nice idea while I waited out the 2-year time. So without anything else in mind, that's what I did. I did my research and found a seemingly nice family in Poland from an Au Pair website who wanted me to be their Au Pair for at least 8 months. I thought that it sounded great, as it would give me a chance to learn a fourth language, plus be able to work and explore the culture.

We videocalled several times and messaged much more often. A trust relationship was set. I did the paperwork for the visa, got an invitation letter from them, and was set to go. 

I was given a type-D visa for 8 months of multiple entries to the Schengen territory.


It was all going well, when, well, it wasn't. The family never let me join any Polish courses, I was working more than 40 hours a week with just 2 free days a month, and my time outside the house was very restricted. Basically, the opposite to what Au Pairs generally do. There was no contract, just what we had discussed (which was the opposite of what I was doing). But I for a fact knew that there is a time limit of work for Au Pairs, Au Pairs are supposed to attend language courses, and are supposed to have at least 1 free day a week. After 4 months of what seemed like house arrest, I could not take it any longer. I talked with the host-family several times, but they never changed their behaviour. So I took the decision to leave, for my own mental health.

Even though I desperately wanted to, I could not go back to Venezuela at that time, as my family did not have the economic resourses to help me pay a flight back. I still had 4 months left of my Visa, and I still had my return flight ticket for the day my Visa expired (so I had to wait 4 months to leave Poland). I couldn't find any other host families in Poland at that time; if I had, I would have stayed there! I rather loved the country! I ended up finding another seemingly-nice family, this time in Spain, and after talking with the family and leaving in awkward and bitter terms, I left for Spain. 

This time, they truly were nice people. I had the best time and created some of my best memories abroad. I taught English to two lovely kids and made many friends. In all the fun and ""finally able to enjoy my time as an Au Pair,"" I did not realise something. 

I had spent 4 months in Poland, and practically 4 months in Spain. 

While I did have a type-D multiple-entry-to-Schengen-countries Visa, this was a Polish one, not a Spanish one. I'm afraid that did not give me the right to stay more than 90 days in another country that wasn't Poland. I genuinely did not know of this until I was already in Spain, and by that time, it was too late, as I had surpassed the 90-day stay there. I still had a few more weeks left in Spain before my flight back, and no one I knew could host me in Poland for the remaining weeks. 

So I stayed in Spain for the rest of my trip and every day I anticipated the worst. I felt like a criminal; it was not my intention to overstay there, not even to go to Spain in the first place, as I had no idea my experience in Poland would be so bad. But as both are Schengen countries, I had no stamp for Spain on my passport when I arrived or left the country. Just Portugal, as it was my layover stop and first entry to an EU country.

After a few weeks of paranoia and on my last days of my Visa, I flew to Warsaw directly from Spain and took my due return flight (the flight back home was from Poland, since it was expected I'd stay there for the entire time). It was basically as if I had never left the country for the past 8 months. I had my passport stamped in Lisbon (layover stop) when I first arrived to Europe, and had it stamped again in Lisbon (layover stop) while leaving Europe. So I repeat: I did not overstay my Visa period at all, I even entered and left Poland the dates the visa said. However, I did stay in Spain for over 90 days whilst only holding a Type-D visa for Poland. There was no proof of that overstay or that I had even been in Spain at all (though I am sure someone certified could see the track of my flights if they wanted to somehow).

So I returned back to Venezuela and no one said anything, I could pass just fine. 

I still had to wait another year to study in Venezuela, so I considered being an Au Pair again, but this time, taking way more precautions. I was actually invited by the same family in Spain to be an Au Pair, and since they were so nice to me and we got very well along, I agreed. During that process of research for the visa, my family left to the United States (my mum got a job there), but I voluntarily did not go with them, as I still would not be able to go to university there. This is all because I just want to study! 

Later, I found out I couldn't be an Au Pair in Spain, since my native language is already Spanish. Thus, I could not get an Au Pair visa. With no other way to get a visa in Spain to stay for longer than 90 days, I ended up going to Spain for less than 3 months this time. I was very afraid I would not be allowed to enter the country and that somehow the Immigration would know about my previous incident, but it was as if nothing had happened. Since I was staying as a tourist for less than 90 days in Spain this time, I felt less paranoid, as my stay was completely legal that time. 

During that time, my host-family, knowing the tough situation in Venezuela and about my family living somewhere else, offered to host me in Spain if I wanted to study in university there. I had never considered the possibility, and it was already getting too dangerous to live alone in Venezuela, let alone without my family with me. So I very thankfully accepted, and after arriving back to Venezuela in December, we began the whole process to apply for the university in Spain.

That leaves me to right now. I am truly scared that once I turn everything in for the Visa solicitude, I will get my application denied, because of that overstay incident that happened almost a year ago. I mean, my passport stamps are all fine, and I have no recorded incidents in any of the European countries I visited. But I am afraid that the Visa people will somehow look at all the flights I've made (is that possible? would they do that?) and see that little overstay in Spain. I'm afraid I'll get rejected because of that, and worse, fined a huge amount I won't even be able to pay.

I’ve never done a layover before, and out of curiousity, I searched up aeroflot to find out the maximum weight allowed for a carry on. As I did my research, it seemed that majority of the reviews were people complaining how their luggage was forcefully checked, had to pay a fee, had their luggage lost, or had most of the items inside the bag stolen. I’m kind of freaking out... I’m a girl and if I’m packing my essentials, this includes skincare, makeup, extra shoes etc and the maximum is 10kg. I feel like it wont be enough and I’d have to check my bag eventually... but with all these horror stories I don’t really know what to think. 

A lot of people also complained that they arrived later than expected to SVO, and they ended up missing their second flight. They also said that they had to pay for the ticket, because the employees said that they had more than enough time to get to the gate, so it wasn’t their fault.... but I was told that I’d have to take a shuttle...

We're starting in Florence, Italy with a group of friends celebrating our 10 year study abroad anniversary. Afterward we'd like to see some new countries we've never been to. We're active outdoorsy people from Colorado. Love hiking, biking, water sports, and nature but also enjoy immersing in new cultures, enjoying good food and drink and experiencing new cities. I know this itinerary is probably trying to cram too much into a short time but I'm having trouble reining it in. My main concern is giving ourselves only a short window for hikes and outdoor activities not taking into account poor weather days. Also, what mode of transportation would you recommend, especially between countries? Renting a car seems nice but also expensive for picking up in one country dropping off in another.

Florence: 3 nights. (non negotiable)

Dolomites: 1 night. We never went up north when we lived in Italy and I hear the mountains are amazing to see and hike plus I'd love to hit up a Prosecco winery for a tasting. Is this long drive/ train from Florence worth it for just 1 night or should we head straight to Slovenia?

Bovec, Slovenia: 2 nights. Hike the Dolomites in the morning and then head to Bovec. Wake up and enjoy a river activity and/or hike.

Lake Bled/ Bohinj: 1 night (worth it to stay here, or should we enjoy the day here and stay in Ljubjlana?

Ljubljana: 1 night. Eat, drink, shop, wander.

Zadar, Croatia: 2 nights. Drive from Ljubljana to Zadar, stopping in Plitvice national park on the way. Nin on day 2.

Sibernik/Skradin: 1 night. Jadrija beach, Krka national park.

Split: 2 nights.  Islands. Will the weather be nice enough for beach time?

Dubrovnik: 2 nights. Island hop, Game of thrones sights (I know cheesy but some of us are fans)

Am an American going to the UK early this summer for a trip in the Cotswolds (a guided trip). I will be staying in Newbury before the trip but have two free days after my appointment in Newbury until I meet up with the group in the Cotswolds (I think we will be based near Mickelton).

May 21:

\-Fly from Orlando, FL to Manchester overnight, then 2hr layover and fly into Zurich around noon.

\-Nothing in particular, just eat/drink. I already have several places in mind, but open for suggestions. Staying at a hostel with private room/shared bathroom, serves breakfast.

&amp;#x200B;

# Lauterbrunnen

May 22:

\-Train from Zurich to Lauterbrunnen Valley. Nothing in particular planned that day either, just enjoy being there. We will probably get some simple groceries. We booked an Airbnb in Stechelberg for 4 nights.

&amp;#x200B;

May 23:

\-Bernese Alps (Tanzbodeli Hike) Grimmelwald to Stechelberg: I found out about this trail from Reddit, but online resources for the Tanzbodeli route are scarce. I feel comfortable enough to do it, but I would love for someone who has done the trail to chime in. Below is my best approximation of the route (mostly from reading a description of the hike): [https://imgur.com/a/Gq0RmBt](https://imgur.com/a/Gq0RmBt)

This is the only thing we have planned for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

May 24:

\-Junfraujoch Scenic Train: I've always wanted to see a glacier. Coming from Florida, it is probably the most alien landscape I could possibly visit. Gondola from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen, train ride from Wengen to Kleine Scheidegg (9am), check out the weather at Junfrau, and book the ticket up there. I only want to reserve the first leg of the trip in case there is bad weather (tickets are non refundable), any thoughts? I heard there was a good place to eat lunch at Kleine Scheidegg. Only thing planned for the day. We might hang out in Wengen, any good places to eat or drink?

&amp;#x200B;

May 25: This will either be a zero day or a day trip to Bern, depending on our mood. Bern will just be for sightseeing and drinking. Plan on being back in Stechelberg that night.

&amp;#x200B;

May 26: Paragliding at Airtime Paragliding. I am so goddamn excited for this! After we will probably get some coffee at the cafe and head up to murren to eat/drink at the Edelweiss Bar.

&amp;#x200B;

# Zermatt

May 27: Early train from Lauterbrunnen to Zermatt. We will probably hit a grocery store and drop bags at the airbnb, then go sightsee, and then go on a fancy date at Chez Vrony. I have heard good and bad things about this restaurant, and am confused on the best way to get there (looks like uber or walking is the only way). I am open to other suggestions, ideally downtown. Would also love some suggestions for bars/drinks. We have an INCREDIBLE Airbnb booked in Zermatt with a hot tub.... :D

&amp;#x200B;

May 28: Chill day. Enjoy the house, get our money's worth etc. Cook at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

May 29: Matterhorn. I have 2 ideas for this day but I am torn between them. One is the new Crystal Ride thing that they built. IIIIIII don't know how I feel about this one. Seems over the top luxurious, and doesn't even get you close to the mountain. The other is taking Gondolas up to Schwarzee, and hiking the trail to Hornilutte, right at the base of the Marterhorn. The trail is 4 mi. round trip with strenuous uphill, and my fiancee isn't a big hiker, so I'm not sure what to do yet. 

# Morschach

May 30: Train from Zermatt to Lucerne. Rent a car in Lucerne and drive to Airbnb in Morschach. My primary reason for choosing this town is because it is near the Stoos Ridge trail, which will surely be a highlight of the trip. My reason for renting a car is that I don't really have much planned here, and I want the ability to do whatever I want without the confines of train/bus travel. It also allows for a certain logistic pertaining to a hike I want to do, which will be discussed below. We want to get massages on this day but I'm having trouble finding a place. 

&amp;#x200B;

May 31: Stoos ridge hike: [https://imgur.com/a/pF0BdzK](https://imgur.com/a/pF0BdzK). Drive from airbnb to gondola to the east, up to the ridge. Walking sections in blue. We'll probably eat at a pizza place up there.

&amp;#x200B;

June 1: Surenenpass hike. At 8-9 hours, my fiancee probably couldn't make it, so I'll be going alone. She will have the car that day to do whatever she wants, and can pick me up from the end of the hike. [https://imgur.com/a/f0jjo05](https://imgur.com/a/f0jjo05)

&amp;#x200B;

June 2: No plans yet, maybe a day trip to Milan or St Gallen. Open to suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

June 3: Train back to Zurich, staying right next to airport since flight leaves at 7:05am.

&amp;#x200B;

June 4: Flight to Manchester, 2 hr layover, to Orlando.

travel,b4wvmp,"We are hopefully going on a trip to Iceland in June. Things I already know:

- Food is very expensive, so instead of going out to eat, just buy food at a grocery store and prepare it where you’re staying.
- Do not stay at normal hotels (chains with front desks, parking, etc). Instead stay at Air B&amp;B, regular bed and breakfasts, hostels, etc. Much less expensive.
- Rent a car. Everything is mostly country roads in between establishments in Iceland. I checked the area and it’s really inexpensive.
- Most attractions are free. It’s almost like a large national park over there.

I guess a few questions I had: 
- What is a fair amount of time to spend there to get an experience, at least with consideration to work. I’m sure you could spend months there and still have a ton left. Currently I am in school on some weekends and I work full time. Most importantly, my job doesn’t give me PTO, so I can’t stay for weeks without worry. I want to be there long enough to experience it, but not too long where I get super stressed about being out of work.
- In June, there is no nighttime. Was wondering if I could get advice on functioning there without darkness? I’ve never experienced that, so I have no idea how that affects your body. 
- Any specific attractions that I should make sure I check out?

travel,b4zidp,"Hi Everyone,

I am in the middle of planning my honeymoon and I’ve been considering many different ideas and I’m struggling with really narrowing down my options so I wanted to see if anyone could provide any insight from their own experiences to help me figure this out.

**Background:**

Our wedding is in mid December and we really want to go on our honeymoon right after the wedding so travel time is about 10 days before Christmas and we are looking to be away for a about a week.

My fiancé has really put the onus on me to plan the whole thing as I do travel quite a bit (even though my travels are primarily limited to Europe and the US) but her only stipulation is that we go somewhere that allows her to relax on the beach. I am pretty open to any type of trip as I can lay around on the beach but I can also do plenty of activities and be on the go. I would like to take a day trip to see some natural or historic sights but I wouldn’t be totally at a loss if we just were bumming around for a week either. We would prefer to stay away from crazy party resorts and prefer more low key bars and restaurants. In an ideal world we could mix having a unique experience somewhere different while still being able to stay at a hotel that would allow to have pool/beach time.

From a budget standpoint, I have about $6,000 in travel rewards that I was hoping to use for my hotel / resort so we can go pretty high end. I was planning on paying for my flight out of pocket but I would be willing to dip into my points if need be. We are traveling from NYC so we have some decent flight options as well.

**Ideas so far:**

Considering the time of year, our location, and my fiancé’s desire for a beach I’ve been focusing on Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. I’ve done a lot of research on different places but I’m traveled to that part of the world so I’m finding it difficult to differentiate between different places. The below are the particular contenders:

**Tulum:**  I love the idea of staying on the beach in a romantic hotel and the ability to take a day trip to see ruins. My fear is that it’s overrun with instagram stars and I don’t truly feel like I’m away.

**Holbox:** Seems more off the beaten path than Tulum but i am slightly concerned is that there is nothing else to.

**Barbados:** similar to Tulum I’m not sure how away from it all id feel and I also don’t know what other activities to do. I am a big fan of rum so I think the distilleries would be a fun day trip but I’m not sure what else there is.

**St. Lucia:** It seems more adventurous than Barbados but I honestly have a hard time distinguishing it from other Caribbean islands. I just see it come up a lot as a popular honeymoon spots.

**Cabo / Todos Santos:** Todos Santos seems like it’s more off the beaten path so that’s intriguing but I’m not sure if the extra travel to get there is worth it.

That’s all the thoughts I have so if anyone has any thoughts on the places I listed or have different places in mind I haven’t mentioned please let me know.

Both countries do NOT require a visa for stays of less than 30 days for Canadians.

travel,b4smfk,"Been spending the last few hours trying to re-think logistics for my family's trip to Croatia, my old parents and my siblings and myself. We're planning on renting a car, and flying in/out of Zagreb. 

We're already planning on spending very little time in Zagreb, just the first night there to get adjusted to the time, and also the last night before our departing flight since it leaves in the morning.

Option A: I was initially thinking of going straight from Zagreb to Split, spending the day and 1 night there, going to Dubrovnik, spending 2 nights there, then going to Plitvice NP, spending the day there, then heading to Zagreb and spending the last night of the trip there. This option came to mind so that we wouldn't be driving all the way to or from Dubrovnik in a single drive. This leaves us only half a day in Plitvice (or maybe Krka), and I read some Reddit post suggesting to get to Plitvice as early as possible. 

Option B that I thought of: land in Zagreb, spend the night in Zagreb, head to Plitvice and spend the day and night there, head to Split the next day and night there, then go to Dubrovnik and spend 2 nights there, then drive all the way back up to Zagreb to spend the last night there. 

If we decided to go with option A, I don't think we could spend the last night in Plitvice since it's a 2 hour drive to Zagreb and our flight is at 11 am.

Any better plans to do those 3 things (Split, Dubrovnik, and Plitvice National Park)? 

Would Plitvice be super busy in mid May that we should get there as early as possible? Would Krka be a better National Park to visit?

 It should extremely easy to dedicate 50% of my income to my needs initially. I won't have to pay rent for my first few years because my parents are more than willing to have me continue to live with them. I'm going to take advantage of that until I can't stand not having my own place anymore. My parents will probably continue paying most of my bills as long as I let them as well.  That should make the transition into paying bills myself and eventually renting out a place a smooth process. 


I'll be dedicating at least 20% of my income to retirement, student loans, and an emergency fund. I'll probably be able to dedicate more to that initially with the lack of ""needs"" I'll have. 


In regards to the 30% dedicated towards ""wants"" that shouldn't be difficult for me. I'm extremely cheap. I'm only going to purchase the bare minimum. I'll indulge in hobbies occasionally, but I'll probably have a hard time spending money generally. I think I could easily put aside 10% of that for vacation. 

That would be $3,000 a year for a vacation (assuming my income never improves, which it will). There's a good shot I'll have 15 vacation days and some more paid sick days every year. If I take off as little as possible I'll be able to take a near 2 week long vacation every year. With $3,000 I probably won't be able to go to the more expensive countries, but I could backpack comfortably in places Southeast Asia and China. The ticket would be the greatest expense. When I start making more money I could consider traveling to Europe and such. It seems like this isn't a bad plan to allow for ""frequent"" vacationing throughout my 20s, but I know I'm simplifying a complex situation. Am I missing something? Am I being naive and unrealistic?

tldr; I'm planning to become a police officer when I graduate. I want my budget to follow the 50/30/20 rule.

travel,b4n15t,"I posted a while back with a general plan/allotment of days. We've finally narrowed down our activities list a bit and would love any last minute tips or critiques regarding the way we've planned the days! We're not the type of people who stick to strict itineraries, so the plans are more like guidelines to make sure we hit up the things we care about the most with options to add more depending on how fast or slow we take it. Leaving in a couple weeks.

**Day 1 (Saturday):** Arrive in Singapore around noon. Hotel is in Chinatown. Check in, walk &amp; eat around the neighborhood at the hawker centres. Don't want to exert ourselves too much after the flight so planning to just wrap up the day by Marina Bay/Gardens for the light shows.

**Day 2 (Sunday):** Start in Little India for breakfast. Head to Kampong Glam to see the mosque and for shopping at Haji Lane, then to Old Airport Road Food Centre. If we have time, go to Orchard Road for even more shopping, then finish up the day in the colonial district with a drink at Raffles perhaps. Art Gallery is on the list if we feel like it. Enjoy nightlife in Clarke Quay.

**Day 3 (Monday):** Go to Orchard Road for shopping if we didn't go the day before, followed by a trip to the Botanic Gardens and Adam Road Food Centre. If we feel up for it, head to Treetop Walk and then the Night Safari. If not, chill out around our hotel area again (and hit up Gardens by the Bay if we were too tired to see them the first night.) 

**Day 4 (Tuesday):** Very early morning flight to Hong Kong. Hotel is in Mongkok. Check in and rest, then slowly explore Kowloon area on foot (Ladies Market, Street Bird Garden, Tsim Sha Tsui.) Either try for an early dinner/drinks at Ho Lee Fook and the Quinary followed by the Victoria Harbour Light Show, or vice versa if we're not hungry that soon. 

**Day 5 (Wednesday):** Take the ferry to Lamma Island for lazy shopping, eating, and hiking. Check out Jumbo Kingdom on the way there or back if it makes sense? Dinner at Juxing Home followed by Cantonese Opera at Ko Shan. 

**Day 6 (Thursday):** Potential day trip to Macau. Eat lots of food and walk around everywhere. Seems like we could start in Taipa and make our way North, or go the other way around. We'll eat egg tarts and African chicken for sure. The famous water show isn't showing during our trip so I don't think we'll stay too late. We don't like gambling so won't spend much time at casinos. I was considering doing the AJ Hackett bungy jump though, if that wouldn't crowd the day too much.

**Day 7 (Friday):** Lantau Island - check out the buddha, Tai O fishing village, and Mui Wo beach? Dinner in Sheung Wan (if we can get the reservation we want!)

**Day 8 (Saturday):** Last day in HK so want to see everything we didn't already see on HK island like Hong Kong Park, shopping in Wan Chai (I've got a few places saved), maybe Shek O beach too? We have a dinner reservation in Wan Chai and will likely go out afterwards. 

**Day 9 (Sunday):** Flight to Kaohsiung mid-morning. Hotel by Liuhe Night Market. Want to check out the Lotus Pond, Pier 2 Art Center, Xinjuejiang Shopping District, and Ruifeng Night Market. 

**Day 10 (Monday):** Train to Tainan (not the HSR.) Hotel close-ish to Tainan Confucious Temple. Don't have much planned here aside from wandering around and eating food. Have considered checking out Taijiang National Park as well.  

**Day 11 (Tuesday):** HSR to Taipei. Hotel by Taipei Main. Not sure what time we will get in - depends on whether or not we want to spend more time in Tainan in the morning. Leaving this day without many plans, maybe just the Huashan 1914 Creative Park followed by Raohe Night Market. If we have extra time we can try to hit up a restaurant on our list that's not particularly near anything else we've planned?

**Day 12 (Wednesday):** Start at Xiahai City God Temple. From there, wander and snack down through Ximendeng all the way to Lungshan Temple. Hang out in Gongguan for a bit (we might do this on Day 1 though if we have time.) Hit up Ningxia Night Market later on if we're still hungry.

**Day 13 (Thursday):** Day trip to Shifen &amp; Jiufen

**Day 14 (Friday):** National Palace Museum, Yangmingshan &amp; Thermal Valley (and Yehliu Geopark? Maybe way too ambitious), Shilin Night Market. It seems like this is a doable, if busy, day. If this is too much we might skip Shilin entirely, or leave the National Palace for its own day. 

**Day 15 (Saturday):** Songshan Cultural and Creative Park, Taipei 101 + Din Tai Fung (we're prepared for the wait!), Maokong Gondola, Tonghua Night Market. 

**Day 16 (Sunday):** Our last day of the trip! Leaving this morning to either revisit somewhere we enjoyed a lot, or hit up an area we missed due to lack of time. Flight home is at 5:30pm.","Critique my itinerary! Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan.",aurorium,1553368694.0,1,0
travel,b4k5r2,"The three of us are in our mid-twenties, females. We’re all teachers so summer is a must - we’re looking to leave the third week of June and spend two weeks traveling. 

We’re *pretty much* confirmed going to explore Belize for two weeks. We had decided on Guatemala, but one friend had a concern of safety, so we switched locations. We’re supposed to book flight this weekend.

Upon research, Belize seems like a whole lot of beach, which is cool. I also realize there are some ancient ruins to check out, some hiking, and the blue hole... 

The thing is, while Belize looks cool, and I am really looking forward to it, I’m wondering if there’s a more ideal destination for what we’re hoping for. Two years ago, we spent 3 months backpacking in Southeast Asia where the experiences we had there still feel like a dream. Obviously without that amount of time and the diversity of experiences each country has to offer, and it was um, Asia... I do not expect a “similar” experience. 

Let me just tell you what we’re looking for, and you tell me if you have any other suggestions before we book. The girls are very open minded so if I showed them some other options, they’d consider.

- Two weeks ish 
- Affordable for a budget. We’re looking to spend less than $2k (each) including airfare. This is a little flexible. So, most of Europe is out of the question.
- This side of the world. One of the friends is moving to Amsterdam this summer, so she’s saving Europe exploration for a bit later 
- Warm, 80 degrees F or above. I think most of South America will be a bit cold at this time?
- Hiking - somewhat challenging, beautiful, waterfalls
- Other outdoor exploring, kayaking, caving and zip lining is fun
- Cultural experiences - chatting with locals, food, some festivals or markets perhaps
-  Safe
- Meeting travelers was a highlight of our past experiences, but not a must 
- Hostels or home-stays, considering the budget 
- I loved exploring Asia on motorbikes, but this is not at all a must...

What do you think? Do you love Belize? Do you like it? Do you you have other ideas?

* Wanaka
* Wai-o-tapu
* Lake taupo
* Milford Sound
* Abel Tasman

 

We couldn't find any flights from Taupo to anywhere in south without flying (back) through Auckland, so the plan is to rent a camper in Auckland, go to Rotorua and either 

\* drive back north to Auckland to fly south to Nelson (or Christchurch and forget Abel Tasman), or

\* drive the camper south and take the ferry to the south island

Will this be fine? Everyone says ""it should match the passport"" but this passport is weird since there's two ""surnames"" so I wasn't sure how to match that up. Apparently, when getting this passport my parents said they were advised to not use the ""apellido de conyuge"" and just use the Apellidos: Name1 Name2 names. Did I do this right? Or should I change the names? (Can I even change the name??)

Bonus question: What exactly is the green card number? Is it that number on the back of the card in the format [three letters][10 numbers]? American airlines asks for the card number and wasn't sure what to put.

travel,b4fb3q,"I'm starting from square one. Lost my passport over ten years ago, so I'm treating this travel as a brand new application. I have been invited to travel abroad with friends in April (15-21). This is a first for me. The last time I was outside the country was to go to Montreal before Canada started requiring passports for travel, so needless to say, I am due.

I fully admit that not applying ahead of time was my folly, but work and other priorities have taken precedence, so here we are. The trip is scheduled for four weeks out, and I am kind of at a loss for what to do. Would it behoove me to wait the two weeks until the expedited service becomes available to me, or should I try my luck at the post office tomorrow since I finally have a day free when I can do such a thing?

All of my documents are in order, I just need to make the thing happen. Please help, I am conflicted.",I am in the sweet spot of four weeks before having to travel abroad. Do I wait or do I jump?,derpyderp2049,1553317884.0,0,0
travel,b4cy21,"So I was a bit late for a Monday flight and I missed my baggage drop-off deadline by 5 minutes and I wasn't allowed to drop-off my checked luggage. The front-desk person at check-in said that they aren't allowed to accept anymore baggages for the flight but he said I could Fedex it to my destination or I could check-in my luggage on another flight to the same destination. I would just have to pick up my baggage at the baggage-claim when it arrives. I said ok, cool. He says that the next flight to my destination was Friday, so he tells me to have my friend hold onto my baggage until friday and then check it in before the flight. Alright, sweet.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had my friend just keep the luggage until Friday. I boarded the plane and got to my destination (home), and I called the customer service of the airlines and they confirmed everything that dude said and that I could get my baggage at baggage-claim when it arrives. I just gotta be at the airport when the plane lands.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today (Friday) and my friend brought my baggage to the same airport and tried checking it in but the supervisor tells her that they can't check-in a baggage without a passenger. I talk to the supervisor and he told me they aren't allowed to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm pissed, because if I knew that it wasn't allowed then I would have Fedexed the first time! Was the customer service person and the first front-desk person correct? Are they allowed to bring baggage without a passenger? Also it sucks cause I paid for my baggage and i don't think I can get a refund.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is my stupid fault for being late, but I'm more pissed that I was given conflicting information from different people in the same airline company.

So I called frontier again, and they're suggesting my friend bring my baggage again for the next available flight to my destination. This flight is on Monday. They said they'll contact their people in that airport and get my baggage on the plane. Do I risk it or should i just tell my friend to fedex my undies to my house??

travel,b4664q,"Given the opportunity meaning you were able to visit any country right now without having to worry about visas or financing. I’m a bit bored at the moment and I feel like this is a fun little community question, so feel free to go into as much depth as possible because I’d love a good read later on. 

For me I would probably have to choose; Pakistan, Iran, India, China and maybe Israel. 

 Pakistan: because it’s such a poorly represented country and very misunderstood. Their government has done a good job at fighting extremism in the majority of the country making a big portion of the country now safe for tourists. It’s full of incredible food as you can easily learn more about by watching Mark Wiens on YouTube about his multi episode food tour of Pakistan. The people of Pakistan can be some of the most hospitable. I’d love to visit the historic cities like Karachi and Lahore and I’d love to do some road trip to the mountains in the north. 

Iran: Try the food (again), I really like middle eastern cuisine, or cuisine from the entire MENA region and its history. I’d love to explore some of the incredible mosques in Iran and to again hopefully make it out to the mountains, maybe some of the Iranian islands would be cool too. To explore the historic sites again of course and learn more about their history/museums as I’m really interested in the MENA region for its hospitality, cuisine and history. 

India: I want to explore every region of India, every.single.province. From the mountains in the northwest (Oof) to the mountains in the Sikkim region. The beautiful artitechture and history of Rajasthan. Really want to explore the northeast by motorbike too. 

China: If it were easier to visit Tibet I’d love to do some treks and learn about the Tibetan culture. I’d really like to visit central/western China for the scenery more than the cities. 

Israel: Recently learned that my great uncle was part of UN peacekeeping missions in Israel and all surrounding countries and he left behind a scrap book with some pictures from Jerusalem and Palestine and I’d just love to visit the places he did. Learn about the Israeli and Palestinian history would be pretty neat too because it’s such an old part of the world.

We have narrowed it down to Iceland and Norway, but my husband would also like to fit in Copenhagen (or Stockholm or both, yikes!).  Since we have never been out of North America, it is sooo enticing to try to fit in as much as we can since all of the countries are so close together!

**Length:** 17 days total, including travel to/from Wisconsin.

**Budget:** Not really an issue; we have been saving for awhile and we will be squirreling more away until December. 

**Interests:**  Food, drink, scenery.  We want to see the beauty of the fjords and the coasts, but we also enjoy what cities might have to offer--several restaurants to check out and/or live music.  We are open to shorter hikes but are not interested in hiking extensively.  We definitely want to see the northern lights.  We also are interested in excursions like dog sledding or snowmobiling.  We are trying to be very mindful of how to see all of the beauty that the countries have to offer while having minimal daylight.    

**Tricky part:**  We need to plan for Christmas Eve and Christmas.  We know that nearly everywhere will be shut down on the 24th and 25th of December.  Where will we have the best experience in finding establishments that are open or best hotel accommodations during Christmas in either Reykjavik, Oslo, Tromso, Copenhagen, or Stockholm?  I've found that some hotels in Oslo will have buffets, but I'm unsure about the other cities' offerings.

**Tromso or Lofoten**  We were leaning heavily towards Tromso until recently--I had read only good things and then I came across a /r/travel thread where a user said it was 24 hours of darkness and not much to do.  The user said that Lofoten was just as beautiful with more sunlight and just as much ability to see the northern lights.  Can anyone weigh in on which city they prefer and why?

Obviously it’s difficult to simply resort to listing them by country since a country can be so diverse and wide but I feel it’s the most “visible” category on paper per se. 

I know most will say easiest countries for beginners would be Western Europe, Aus and NZ, Canada and US, East Asia barring China UAE

Easy-to-mid probably is Central Europe (Hungary Austria Czechia Poland) and maybe parts of the Baltic (Estonia Latvia Lituania), SE Asia (Thailand Vietnam Malaysia) barring Myanmar and Laos, a good portion of Latin America (Chile Argentina Peru Mexico etc), Morocco and Tunisia, Jordan Oman and Israel Lebanon 

Medium is Rest of Latin America barring Venezuela Guyana El Salvador and Honduras, Eastern Europe like Ukraine Russia and Belarus, India, China, South Africa, Nepal, Turkey Sri Lanka Ghana Jamaica

Medium-to-Hard would be Egypt, Central Asia + Mongolia, Bhutan Cuba Senegal Namibia Tanzania Ethiopia Kenya Iran Papua,New Guinea

Difficult would be Haiti Pakistan Turkmenistan Bangladesh Myanmar Guyana El Salvador

I'm currently knee deep into planning my Summer Europe trip and could use some help. Here is a current [Tentative Itinerary](https://postimg.cc/WFFQC5Dj). I really enjoy nature and hiking, and would really like to get into the Alps. After some consideration, I think I would like to cut out Switzerland and allocate some of those days towards exploring the Bavarian Alps (not sure if this is what they are called), basically the region south of Munich. 

Logistically, I could not find a viable way home (Orlando, FL) from Switzerland, everything was either much to expensive, involved traveling out of the way, or had a 10+ hour layover. I looked into flying back to Amsterdam and catching a flight home from there, however it looks like that would be complicated as the Lauterburren area -&gt; Zurich is ~3hour train ride which would make for 2 back to back days of long travel. Alternatively, I was thinking I could fly Ghent --&gt; Munich, explore the city for a few days, then try and make my way south towards the Alps, eventually ending back up in Munich and taking a train to Nuremburg -&gt; Prague -&gt; Bologna (flight w/ Ryanair) - &gt; Florence (including Cinque Terre) -&gt; Paris (Flight) -&gt; Home. I found a great deal on a nonstop flight home from CDG airport.

The cheapest flight I could find was with AirAsiaX. The flight on its own was around $800 per person. We will need to buy additional baggage for at least one of us, so that added is $190. my partner also wants a twin seat, so that could be anywhere upwards of $40 each. There will be no food for the whole flight without additional costs, and the departing airport isn’t very nice. The flight is 18hrs there and 21hrs back with pretty long layovers. In total, that’s about $1070 per person.

One of the more expensive flights was with Thai Airways. It’s about $1,250 (edit: updated price), with everything included (food, seats, amenities, baggage, etc) and the flight time is down to only 16 hours each way. Shorter layovers and it departs from the main airport.

These are just general markers, there’s probably a better deal I could find out there somewhere. Just wondering what people suggest? Thanks.

travel,b4493d,"I am planning on going to Switzerland this May 2019. I have been reading about transportation and overall feel discouraged to rent a car. It seems that going into towns and cities there is only paid parking, you can't park on the side of a road and just walk around. Am I perceiving things wrong? 

Also,  to  reach most mountain ranges you are limited if you have a car. A train pass will get you further. Is that a fair statement? 

I was looking to make a town close to Interlaken my base and wanting to do the train system because of what I have read so far but I am concerned about going out to explore all day and returning to a long walk with lost of steep hills and more walking to do when you are just ready for bed. Otherwise, I would have to stay in town center which it turns out very expensive. Am I understanding this correctly? I would like to get of a train walk 10 mins max and arrive at my home away from home. Is there a good base town close to Interlaken but not as expensive with train system close by?

My last question. I have seen some rental places provide a town pass, it allows you to get on trams or even free taxi, I read on one? I am not sure I have ever seen something like this. Is this common, or do some towns have and others don't? 

I know I am asking tons of questions but I just want to make my trip memorable but affordable yet enjoy the Alps. I am taking my parents as they love traveling too and they are in their 70s but are still healthy and strong. I just don't want over do it for them..

I’m going to Europe next month (London, Paris, Amsterdam, Italy) and I do not know what to do for my phone.

While budget airlines have been trying to kill long-distance rail journeys, we at times may all enjoy being back in the good old days of Paul Theroux books and enjoy the view of landscapes slowly rolling by the windows, being 'in there' instead of somewhere 'up there' over the clouds at 40k feet. Train trips can feel like proper part of the journey, instead of interruptions of it.

travel,b3xp00,"Hello, first time posting here.

I’m gonna be travelling South America this June and have set my eyes on a bit of hopping around the continent. Don’t worry I’m not trying to see everything in one fell swoop ;)

Anyway, I’m going from Rio to Foz de Iguazú, to Buenos Aires to Lima (with plane between them). My family is gonna be in Los Angeles from end of June so I need to be there in that time.

After landing in Lima I’m making my way to Cusco with bus to see some of the sights on the way, where I’ll be going to Machu Picchu. After that I’ll be heading to Iquitos for my Amazon jungle fix (which is what I want most to experience on my travel).

However I’ve always had a thing for the Caribbean, and really would like to experience some part of it on my travel when I’m kinda in the neighbourhood so to speak. I have 5 days-ish on my itinerary left for this purpose and I was wondering about making a stop in Cartagena after Iquitos by flight, since I’ve heard so many good things about this place. I also always wanted to see Cuba and Havana but sadly think that won’t happen this time as the flights to there seem quite expensive from SA.

My question is what I should do with my last few days if I want to experience some of the Caribbean vibes. Should I go to Cartagena, Cuba or somewhere else. And most importantly it has to be easy to get from there to Los Angeles so I’ll meet my family in time.

I know crazy stuff, but that’s how it is and I would be grateful for any help to make these last few days a perfect ending to my SA/Latin America experience :)

PS! I checked some boats from Cartagena to panama where I could also take a flight from to LAX, but is this a viable option considering other factors?

Thank you all so much!:)",I need some help with the last few days of my itinerary in South America...,wonderchin,1553211173.0,0,0
travel,b3xix4," Hi all, I'm heading to Germany at the end of April / early May and have about a week in Berlin. During this time I'm planning on doing a day trip out to Hamburg (solo on train) and also out to Dresden (with a tour group); I'm also planning on heading out to Potsdam for a half day or full day (haven't decided yet).

What I'm wondering, is would it be better to make my own way to Potsdam (heard it's like an hour on the train, maybe more?) or go with an organised tour? I'm currently on the fence because, the tours will be all outside and if I book this far out I don't know what the weather would be like (want to go on a sunny day). I also like history and learning about cultures etc. I'm pretty introverted so don't mind wandering around by myself as well.

If I go solo, I'd also probably take a bike with me on the train so I can get around easier.

travel,b3x8ef,"Hi all,

My husband and I are traveling to India on April 22 - May 9th. I'd like to do the e-visa, we are just going for vacation. I'm just wanting to clarify a few questions I have after reading their website

\- The validity of e-Tourist Visa and e-Business Visa will be one year from the date of grant of ETA. Multiple entries will be permitted on e-Tourist Visa and e-Business visa.In case of e-Conference visa, validity will be 30 days from the date of arrival in India.

From reading this paragraph, I think it means my tourist visa is good for 1 year. I can have multiple entries into India.  
My brain can't process what the heck the ""Validity will be 30 days from the date of arrival in India."" Does that mean we can only book within the 30 day time period before our trip? So we are leaving April 22, so we couldn't apply for the e-visa until March 24th?

&amp;#x200B;

Is that correct? Sorry, not sure why I'm having a hard time processing that paragraph, but just wanted to make sure! ",USA to India E-visa,osmitrol,1553208666.0,1,0
travel,b3x47r,"On June 7th, I fly from the US from Norwegian airlines from NYC to London. I purchased LowFare+, which states that it includes the following for baggage:
""Baggage:
Cabin baggage x 1, Max 10 kg, Max 55 x 40 x 23 cm
Checked baggage x 1, Max 20 kg, per pcs
Meal x 1, Nice&amp;Tasty Menu

I'm from the US so we don't use the metric system, but I know that it basically says 21 x 15 x 8in for cabin baggage. I want to bring my laptop (15"") and my camera set (it's a Nikon Coolpix something or other, not too big,) and I'm assuming I have to bring it into the cabin with me and can't put it into my luggage.

Now, it doesn't seem to have any demensions for anything in regards to the hold luggage (which I assume is ""checked baggage,"" so I'm not sure how big you're actually allowed to have it until it's definitely not allowed.)

Why do I ask?
Well, my flight connects like USA&gt;LONDON&gt;PORTO, PORTUGAL , and the second flight (after a 8 hour layover) will be using Easyjet, which has different size requirements. There is no indication of whether or not my bags will be transferred automatically, or if I have to check them in separately and pay for separate baggage checks. EasyJets rules read as follows:

Cabin baggage
Max size 56 x 45 x 25cm

There’s only room for up to 70 cabin bags in the overhead lockers and they fill up quickly. All remaining cabin bags will be put into the hold.

Hold luggage1 x 23kg hold bag

But I am not sure what this may mean dimensionally - I have heard that EasyJet's checked baggage rules are very strict and different - what size luggage am I allowed to bring that fits both airlines? ""Maximum total size (length + width + height) = under 275cm,"" it says on EasyJets website.

If anyone wants to know, I booked through Google Flights, which apparently redirected me to ""Gatewick.""

We are staying for two nights, since this destination is a stop between Budapest and Kraków, both of which we've already booked AirBnBs for. 

We are traveling on a medium-low budget - we're hoping that we can keep daily spending under 35 euros, excluding accommodation. Since this is at the end of our trip, I'm guessing that we'll be somewhat reduced and not as eager to explore, so if either city is less hectic and/or better for recreation, that's good.

My partner and I are heading to Italy April 25 to May 9th flying in and out of Rome. I haven't been out of the US of A since 2007 (a shame I  know) and I'm looking to do this right. I really need some help figuring out the second leg of our trip which will be the Amalfi Coast. Here's the game plan:

April 25-28: Rome.

May 2: Travel day - Florence &gt; Naples &gt; Sorrento. 

May 3: Flexibility starts here. But I'll tell you what we're thinking. 

May 4: Positano with day trip to Ravello; May 5: day trip to another town. May 6-8 Ischia Island. 

Here are the musts: Ravello, Ischia Island (or Capri- but Ischia looks more our speed), take a private or group boat ride, beaches, moderate walks. Some other ideas but not set in stone: Positano, Path of the Gods, Amalfi (town), Minori, Maiori. 

Questions- 

1. What is a good homebase for those who want to relax and see sites? Positano? Sorrento? Amalfi? Everything I read says bus transit can be slow and crowded. We don't want to waste time. We would rather ferry around if possible. I guess what is going to be a good taste of AC but not super touristy? 
2. Would it better to just do a day trip to an island like Ischia? Or stay on the island?
3. Are we missing out if we don't spend a night west of Positano like Praiano, Minori, Maiori?

I'm Canadian so I don't need a visa. We are going to be in Europe for approximately 190 days, and starting in France. I understand the schengen rules quite well and have a list of countries I plan to visit that are not in the schengen zone (ie the UK, Balkans, possibly Georgia, etc.).

I do not have places we will be or dates when we will be there, just a rough route with a handful of ""must-sees"", and everything else we do in the way is just bonus. I am concerned this may be an issue when entering schengen countries as we will likely be jumping in and out of the area. Do they generally just take your word for it and make sure you understand the rules, or will I need to provide concrete proof of bookings in non-Schengen countries?

I’ve been really interested in the botany of Southeast Asia. Specifically, by the many mango cultivars that we lack in the US. Here, we have about 2 or 3 varieties. I would be beyond thrilled to learn more about the many mango varieties in Southeast Asia I know nothing about. I believe the Thai mango season is from April to July, which is right around the time I’ll have time free.

I have lab experience, so I was considering volunteering for lab positions for a month or two with university researchers that study mangos. However, despite finding some people to approach, I’m not sure how amenable anyone would be to some rando approaching them, not speaking Thai, just curious about collecting samples for them for a short period of time.


I wanted to travel to Thailand because it seems friendly and easy to navigate, but my heart isn’t set on it. 

It would be my first trip solo, I don’t speak anything other than English and a little Spanish. I’m female, so I’m fairly, if overly concerned about safety.

I have both a US and Irish passport and am excited to do some traveling around Europe on an EU passport this summer (we're doing Italy this year!)

However this question is about my dad, who is an Irish citizen. At the tail end of our trip we are going to Ireland for a family wedding. My dad is renewing his passport currently however we're a little worried about when we come back into the States because he has 2 DUIs and a drunken disorderly on his record. I know when you scan the PP at customs they can access records. Does anyone know if this would be an issue for him? 

I'm really hoping not but it would suck and be really stressful to have an issue at the airport.

A bit about me: will be traveling solo, in my early 30s, I make a solid income and have no children or debt so have a bit of leeway with my budget (could afford a $10,000 trip without any hardship but am also not such a baller that I never have to think about budgeting). I’ve been on two “traditional” cruises before but it’s not really my travel style - I usually like solo/independent travel and don’t enjoy large group/arranged tours. That said, I have spent a bit of time on sailboats (never more than 3 days at a time) and have loved it. I’ve also already decided on a cruise-based trip and not land-based (I want to go to more far-flung islands and have the budget to do so). 

In my research, it seems most 8 day tours either go northwest or southeast. I’ve had a lot of trouble determining which route would be better, as the islands I’m most interested in (eg Española and Fernandina) are far apart and can’t both be done on an 8 day itinerary. That said, I can’t get a good feel for the islands by pictures/reading, so I don’t really have a clue which I’d like the best.

With all that said, I’m considering combining two midrange itineraries on a sailboat, for 15 days total. This would cost about $7500 (plus flights and other expenses, so probably just under $10k). I’m not sure if this is way too long on the boat and if I’ll regret it (again, I’ve done shorter stints on sailboats, but never 15 days). Has anyone spent this long on the Galapagos? Has anyone spent less time but wished they had extended it? And if you think that 8 days will feel like plenty, were there any standout or unmissable islands for you? I’m not set on either northwest or southeast at this point. 

Note: while it would be amazing to find a last minute bargain, at this stage in my life/career, I have more money than time and will only be able to take &lt;three weeks off work, so I can’t risk showing up at the last minute in hopes of finding a good deal.

A couple of specific questions:

I'm not sure what to do with our luggage on days where we switch hotels, especially between cities. It seems most hotels check out in the morning, but don't allow check-ins until the afternoon. Some sites suggest shipping luggage from hotel to hotel, but that gets expensive, while some suggest finding lockers in convenience stores, but that can be unreliable. Any advice on that would be much appreciated.

We'd both really like to see some shows while we're there, like Kabuki or Bunraku, but I'm having a hard time finding scheduling for it. The major theaters in Osaka seem to be in between showings while we're there. Robot Restaurant is listed in just about every single travel sight I read, but I'd like to see something a little more traditional than that.

&amp;#x200B;

my husband and I are on the very early stages of planning a vacation this October. We wanted to go somewhere in Europe and are considering Greece and Italy for 14 days. Below I have a very rough itinerary before we get into planning. We wanted to fix the days we are spending at each place first before deciding exactly what we want to do based on the time allocated to each place.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking instead of flying to Venice, would it be better to just fly into Rome and skip Venice all together? We are both into nature and scenery (hiking and activities) rather than big cities and museums. 

&amp;#x200B;

This won't be the last time we will be visiting both these countries so please don't suggest to replace one city/island with another. We specifically want to go to these places on our first visit but need help in deciding how many days we should spend at each city/island and if we should move things around. If you think we should just skip one altogether, you can let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this itinerary seem realistic? We are both in our late 20s and are fairly active and don't drink or go clubbing. So not big on the night life or wineries. We ususally start our days at 5-6am.

the student visa is looking more and more unlikely. i would have to pay for the classes, which are quite expensive and time consuming (20 hours a week), and the closest honorary consulate to me is 4 hours away. so it’s probably easier to just get the normal 90 day tourist visa.

Sure, there is some inconvenience in checking out, schlepping your bags to the new place, and then finally checking in and getting your room. However, I think there are significant pros:

\- Explore two different hotels or even styles of accommodations (e.g.: hotel vs hostel vs airbnb)

\- Stay in two completely different neighborhoods which can give a very different vibe -- for example staying near Leicester Square and then moving over to Shoreditch.

\- There can be some cost savings (however I don't think moving would be worth it if staying in similar style hotels or in the same area unless the savings are massive).

Me and my BF are planning a 3 weeks trip to Europe this summer. This is the main idea (all by train):

* Paris - 4 days
* Amsterdam - 4 days
* Cologne -1 day
* Strasbourg - 1 days
* Grindelwald /Jungfrau region - 7 days

My family (mom, dad, brother, and I) take family trips every year. Now that I am in a pretty serious relationship, my boyfriend gets to accompany these trips! So, today we are headed back from a week in Curacao (which has AMAZING snorkeling, by the way). We have a layover in Miami before heading home to Kansas City and our plane (2:10pm departure) desperately needed 2 people to volunteer to take the later plane (9:30pm departure). At first they offered $500, which is a lot, but we have dogs to get home to, and college to return to tomorrow. Then rapidly, they begged for 2 people, who would get meal vouchers for the evening wait, and $750 A PIECE to take the later flight. We jumped on it. So, now we have a transportation voucher, which we would like to use this June for our anniversary, but we have no clue where to go! So, I need the help of some smart redditors.

Snorkeling, Walking, Observing, Pretty Much Everything Honestly, we are really open

**Other important notes:**

**Neither of us will be 21. I am 19 and he is 20, so we cannot drink legally in the USA. Renting a car is also difficult given our age.**

\-the visa- i can buy it at the gate before i fly, that is a certainty yes? ( i know the insurance is included in the ticket, for that very reason should i print a copy of the ticket just in case?)

My wife and I (age 29)  are trying to plan a summer destination somewhere in the US. The cities that we love the most are Telluride and Sedona.

Vancouver… although this seems like a rather expensive trip

 My friend and I(2 people) arrive on a Thursday night at Tel Aviv and fly out the next Saturday morning i.e. 8 days in total. During this time, we've briefly thought of the following itinerary:

 - 2 days at Jerusalem: Exploring the whole historical / Biblical / archaelogical side of this part of Israel. 
 - 1 day at Tel Aviv: To examine the urban scene and go out clubbing
 - 2 days to cover the following: Masada hike, Dead Sea + tenting in the Negev Desert (preferably the Ramon Crater)
 - 1 day: Golan Heights, Sea of Galilee, ATVing
 - 1 day to check out Ramallah
 - 1 day - Gush Etzion and surrounding areas. 

On the whole, we'd like to cover the following:

 - Israel history: Archaeological remains to WWII related history
 - Adventure sports: Some rappelling , ATVing, caving if we can
 - Cover enough of Israel to get a feel of the place rather than just doing the standard touristy highlights.
 - Religious sites: We are not religious, but would like to cover some religious sites that are important from a historical / cultural perspective. 
 - War related: Important sites from the various wars Israel has fought since nation creation. This category could overlap with the historical point above. 

We are not sure if this is either too relaxed an itinerary or too crowded. I'd love to hear from you. 

Ideally, I'd like to rent a motorcycle or a car and drive around Israel, check out the culture and scene there, and hopefully be able to check out Haifa and Acre. Are we missing out on any important places to see? Are any of the places above overrated, or have we budgeted too much / too little time?

travel,b2rlxn,"A few days ago my friend and I arrived to the airport for a long awaited trip to France and Spain. We spent days planning and then carefully packed to stay under Norwegian’s strict 10kg carry on limit. We got to the check in counter, our bags squeezed in under the weight limit. We were so excited. But then our hearts dropped when we were told at the check in counter that we couldn’t get our tickets because my friend had less than 3 months left on her passport.

We came to learn at the most inopportune time possible that many European countries (those in the Schengen Area) require 3 months remaining on your passport after your planned departure date from the Schengen Area.

Now we have about 1000 dollars of expenses that we can’t recoup because of Norwegian Airlines predatory business practices. Norwegian Airlines does not make this 3 month rule publicized to customers when booking even though they specialize in international travel to/from European destinations and they falsely claimed that they “verified” our passports during the online booking process. We put in the passport information (including the expiration date) and they gave us no notice at the time that our passports would not allow us to board the plane. **I asked the employee at the check in counter why we weren’t told during this passport verification step and he said “Oh yeah that verification step doesn’t do anything. You could type anything into that.”** That is what I call lying to customers. I truly wonder if a class action lawsuit against Norwegian Airlines would be possible. They are clearly lying about this verification step. Norwegian has been repeatedly avoiding answering what this verification step actually does in my emails to them.

And this is clearly NOT an uncommon situation for Norwegian Airlines. I submitted expenses to Norwegian Airlines trying to get them to cover some of the costs of the trip that I couldn’t recoup. I claimed that they were negligent and lied saying that they verified my passport online only to then deny me entry onto their flight. Funny thing is, they have a templated email to send to customers for exactly this situation. In their email back to me they accidentally sent me a snippet of the template, here it is:

***“(If necessary pls add info related to the individual claim, such as “on this occasion your passport expired less than 3 months before your return date and so on )”***

In their response to me they pointed me to the most hidden place possible in their “Conditions of Carriage” claiming it’s a passenger’s responsibility to make sure their documents are sufficient to enter the country. It's in a section labeled ""Administrative Formalities"". Other sections actually have useful titles like ""Tickets"" and ""Fare, Taxes, and Charges"". Of course they make no effort to notify customers of this before booking and give a false sense of security through their fake passport “verification” step during the online booking process. A reasonable customer would not think they would need to research any further after seeing this verification. Yes, I know, in hindsight I should have done more research. But Norwegian Airlines really deceived me with a false sense of security with this fake verification.

It’s clear why the company wants to do this. Not warning customers about passports equals more people booking tickets on their airline, more change fees to their airlines when passengers are forced to change their travel plans to a later date, and kicking people off the flight because of passport issues allows them to overbook flights.

&amp;#x200B;

*All I want out of this is to get more eyes on this rule and enough negative press on Norwegian Airlines to pressure them into providing customers more of a fair warning. It'd be so easy for them to give a little warning banner when booking a flight to many of their European destinations and it would save so much wasted time, tears, sadness, and lost hard earned money on vacation costs (flights, time off, hotels, events, etc).* ***Help me out and upvote this! I don't want anyone else to go through the horrible experience we had.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL/DR**: YOU NEED AT LEAST 3 MONTHS LEFT ON YOUR PASSPORT AFTER YOUR PLANNED DEPARTURE DATE FROM MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (those in the Schengen Area). Norwegian Airlines had an online passport verification step which claimed our passports were verified. That was a lie. It does nothing. The Norwegian Airlines agent at the counter said we could have typed ""anything"" into the verification tool. We weren’t allowed to board our flight because our passport expired in 2 months. Norwegian Airlines then accidentally sent me an internal piece of a templated email after I contacted their customer service. This snippet they accidentally sent shows that rejecting customers with passports expiring in less than 3 months is likely a common business practice for them. They of course provided zero refund



Edit: Unsurprisingly there’s a lot of internet muscle flexing going on in the comments about how dumb I was not to do more research. The problem is the average poster here is far better informed on what they need to do to travel internationally than the average traveler. There remains a lot of room for improvement to make this rule easier to learn about for the average traveler. I maintain 2 main points.

1. it’s unintuitive for the airline to claim that my passport is verified for travel when it’s actually not. If they’re not actually checking it, they should make that clear. Travelers have no way of knowing they could type ‘anything’ into that verification box. 
2. Airlines should simply put up a warning banner about the Schengen Area rule when booking flights into this area. It’d be the customer obsessed thing to do. It’s an incredibly simple rule - 3 months past your planned departure date. Putting up a warning with info about the rule would expose them to no liability. The reality is, a lot of people don’t know about this rule and don’t know to need to look for it. Putting up a warning would only yield less sadness in the world, as it would help prevent travelers like me from a horrible experience.

Curious if there's other places like this in the US/in the world? Places (indoor or outdoor) that showcase creative/outsider art, reward exploration, and aren't just geared toward kids? Not everything on Atlas Obscura really gets at this, and some of the folk art museums I've been too like AVAM in Baltimore, while fun, are still very much in the ""museum"" mold.

travel,b2d5o7,"Hey all. In the summer I will be traveling to Europe and while looking at flights I saw a huge difference in prices. A nonstop flight through one airline was ~nine hours and about $1,500 while a five hour layover (making total travel time ~fourteen hours) flight was ~$800, substantially less money. That’s about a $700 difference. However, if I do the layover flight I will likely be traveling alone and won’t know what to do for five hours. I think I would be morning/noon in the country during the layover. 

For those wondering how much money matters to me or whatever, $700 is a big difference in flights. While the $1,500 round trip price is understandable, saving all that money would be nice, but I don’t usually do layovers and that would make the total travel time a long time. In a way I’d rather stick out the nonstop flight but I’m not sure.

travel,b2a49w,"Hi all, I'll be traveling through Europe with a some friends in May. I was hoping to get a bit of feedback on our itinerary as I think it's a little packed, especially when factoring in travel time. I looked through some past itineraries on this subreddit and confirmed. The only cities set in stone are the arrival and departure cities.

A bit of background: We are 4 guys in our early 20s and are open to just about anything (hiking, historical sites, less obvious attractions like wine tastings, etc.). We'll only be taking a backpack each. I'm a fairly experienced traveler but not everyone in the group is the same way. We are fairly big drinkers, but don't want that to dictate our daytime itinerary (except maybe a brewery tour at some point). We have one person in the group with a lower budget, but there's really no reason why we can't split up for individual things. We are using AirBnB since our group size means we don't save money using Hostels. Planning on traveling using a combination of trains and overnight buses.

Day 1: Arrive in London

Day 2: Travel to Brussels 

Day 4: Travel to Amsterdam 

Day 6: Berlin 

Day 8: Dresden 

Day 9: Prague with a day trip to Kutna Hora at some point

Day 12: Cesky Krumlov 

Day 13: Vienna 

Day 16: Split, Hvar?

Day 19: Fly to Mykonos

Day 23: Fly out of Athens

Some of my thoughts: I felt like the itinerary was a bit too urban and monotonous just hopping from city to city. So, I added a few less visited locations. I originally wanted to include Hallstatt, Austria, but I figured I should just save that region + Bavaria for a trip on its own. Also, since we're in our 20s, I figured our attention spans aren't actually that long meaning that we'll end up going through museums and historical sites a bit faster than average.

Any help and advice on our plan would be greatly appreciated! Also, any off-the-beaten-trail places that you're happy you had a chance to experience would also be amazing. ",3-Week Western and Central Europe Itinerary,ncjjj,1552857352.0,5,0

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my gym history: 

\-Got into weight lifting in high school

\-At 18 (2010), a trainer at my gym abused me. The gym protected him and I was so ashamed I just quit working out and tried to move on with my life. All I could do was run outside for exercise comfortably. 

\-Worked up to joining a gym in 2017 (was living in a very very small town and was 1 of 3 girl members at the gym). On my second day there a guy walked into the women's locker room and tried to abuse me. I quit working out immediately. 

\-2018 I move away and decide to join an all women's gym. Weights section is always empty so I focus my efforts there and basically fall in love again. 

\-By the end of the year I realize the gym does not have enough plates for me to keep progressing and I'll have to go elsewhere. There are no women at that gym to spot for me anyway, so it was inevitable. 

\-4 weeks ago, I resolve to hire my personal trainer who has a private facility (no open gym) so I can bide my time before having to join a co-ed facility. 

\-To date, He has helped me add 60 pounds to my american deadlift, 70 to my glute bridge, and 50 to my back squat among other successes. He basically tells me I never needed a PT and he thinks I should join a gym. My first reaction is to be angry, because if I am giving you money you should just take it and let me have my comfort zone. My second reaction is that I know he is right, and I do need to stop avoiding the real issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I can find a gym where I feel ok and it will just be temporarily uncomfortable. I also know that not all guys are abusive, so that fear can be managed as well. My real hesitation is that I will have to find someone to spot me, because my PT won't be there. Letting someone into my personal space at the gym is indescribably uncomfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to ask someone to spot for me. I am beyond petrified that if I ask a guy to spot me, he will assume I am low-key asking for more than that. Plus, wouldn't it annoy 99% of people to have some stranger cut into their workout time to ask for a spot? I feel like I am asking a stupid question here, and the answer is probably to just stop being a baby but my social skills are short-circuiting thinking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Update: I talked with my PT about it. He developed a plan with me to meet with him 2x a week for six more weeks with the promise that I attend at least 1 of his CrossFit group classes per week. The hope is this will help me get comfortable working out in crowded spots and being in a predominantly male setting. Then he’s going to start seeing me only 1 day a week for 8 weeks with group class 2x a week and set me up at a gym where some of his other clients go so I have some foundation to work off of. At the end of that cycle I’ll most likely just do 2 group classes and 2-3 days on my own. I feel pretty at ease with this plan, because I trust his judgment and know he’ll set me up with people who have good character.

Fitness,b7nwk1,"Serious question - sorry if this was debated dozens of times before.

If you are natural, will it really make a differernce if you’re weight-lifting or just doing pushups/dips/pullups for your upper-body? The reason why I’m stressing on natural is because you’ll never be so cut to notice every little muscle development.

I know that in the grand scheme of things there will be some weaknesses, but are they even noticaboe if your hypertrophy is natural?

For instance, going from 10 max pullups to 20 max pullups in half a year while slowly gaining weight is going to induce hypertrophy in the lats and biceps as much as weighted pullups/curls/and rows would. Arguably, maybe even more given that you’re not overworking your joints with added weight and so you’re recovery time is faster, thus more room for volume. Same thing for dips/pushups: yeah you can bench/OHP, but going from 20 normal pushups to doing 50 decline pushups while slowly bulking is going to induce hypertrophy in the chest/shoulders/triceps.

Fitness,b7qps4,"Hi Folks,

once upon a time, in my 20's, I was a consistent exerciser. I frequently did HIIT, cardio, weights, and maintained a decent level of physical fitness. Now at 37, I am *very* out of shape. If I'm being honest with myself, it has been 3ish years since I exercised with any consistency and I have a very sedentary job. Of course, all of this shows in the fact that I'm about 25lbs higher than my normal weight, I don't feel strong, and I tire quickly. I resolve to change this and regain a level of fitness that helps support a more energetic and active life. The last 10 days, I've been walking 12,000 steps a day, just to build a base of physical activity. My pace is relatively slow (3.5mph) but right now I'm just working on consistently moving more. Today, my daughter and I went to the park and played soccer for like 10 minutes, afterward I felt exhausted. It was hardly much running, probably several short and relatively slow ""sprints"". But literally, I feel like I just ran a marathon. Situations like this show me how far I have to go and it is intimidating. I've never been this out of shape and I have a fear that I will stay this way forever (irrational, I know. But that is how it feels). 

Here is my question, for those of you who started where I am, what would you add next? Brief HIIT training w/ and HR monitor? Weights? Both?

As this program asks from linear progression of weights I have been increasing the weights whenever I can.
Now after 3 weeks I can bench 50kg, deadlift 55kg but squat only for 30kg!

I tried to increase the weight but the gym trainer says my form is becoming bad. He has asked me to to stick to lower weight for few more times till I can get perfect form and then increase weight slowly.
He also says I try to lift the heavier weight with my back rather than hamstring. What does it even mean even though I am not rounding my back?

Also the trainer makes me do very deep squats like almost sitting which makes it harder to come back straight.

Now I am worried if my squats with be left way behind of other major lifts?

I’m just a 20 year old guy who wants to have a nice aesthetic physique, looking good on the beach , does not care about being the strongest guy in the gym or big like Arnold. More of a physique like Michael B Jordan in black panther but more lean would be the goal. I guess sort of like Zyzz. 

Edit: I wake up at 4am work 6-6 come home have to study for 3 hours , meal prep and by that time it’s already 11:00pm hit the gym and come back to get 4 hours of sleep so just fuck off about “excuses and being lazy” . Also, I’ve decided to keep the deads and squats in my programming.

Edit 2: like someone else said: I want to look aesthetic to normal people not to body builders. I could care less about legs (not to say that I am going to neglect them). Aesthetics are all relative to who you are trying to impress. I think it’s safe to say for the general population it’s more about having a nice beach body and something to do than anything else. And since there seems to be an awful confusion about this, I’m not “afraid of getting too big” I realize that’s not what happens. I’m just saying my goal is x amount of muscle or not x amount.

Fitness,b7fjp5,"Race season kicked off 3 weeks ago (I'm a cyclist), and my performance in the first 2 races was poor. Low power, high perceived effort, and losing to people who I easily beat last season. I'm trying to read the symptoms and determine if I'm overtrained, or if I'm actually undertrained and need to increase my volume. Would welcome armchair advice if you have any.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m overtrained:

* I took 4 weeks to get over a lower respiratory infection in Feb
* Overall poor sleep quality for the last 9 months (new baby waking up every night, usually 6 hours or less per night)
* Have rides when I feel strong, and rides when I have no power, even after a period of rest
* In general have not taken significant time (&gt;5-7 day stretch) off the bike in several years
* Workouts maintain a high level of intensity year round (Zwift racing on my stationary trainer in the winter)
* HR while exercising seems to be lower than in the past
* Much higher work and personal stress than usual in the last 9 months

&amp;#x200B;

I’m undertrained:

* Overall training volume is low (5-8 hours per week for the last 9 months)
* Typically I ride my bike to work every day, which I don’t track, but I’ve had much lower commute volume this winter due to terrible weather in the midwest (my commute is approx 40 minutes roundtrip by bike)
* In the last 6 months, workouts have rarely exceeded 90 minutes, whereas races are usually in the 2 hour range
* Lower respiratory infection from Feb still has lingering, asthma-like symptoms
* I usually follow a hard workout with an easy one / recovery the next day
* I always take one day a week off

* Male/29/5'10""/170lb BW eating around 2600 kcal/day, protein around 200g
* Squat - 195 (3/3/3/1/-) Dropped the bar, in power rack with guards set, so no injury
* Bench - 135
* Deadlift - 205
* OHP - 80
* Row - 135

Progress has slowed significantly since I hit 1xBW squat but no deloads (I have had weight amounts that took extra sessions to do full sets/reps, but never dropped bar or had sets that bad). 

Should I continue to follow the SL schedule? If continue and end up deloading (seems likely), I will likely not hit the goal in 4 weeks.

Should/Could I try to add an extra day of squats/leg work or extra exercises m/w/f? Currently I only do the 3 exercises 3x per week suggested by the program. 

Should I do a different set of exercises focused only on improving squat for 4 weeks to push for the goal and just do maint on other muscles? Of note, the plan was to switch to a PHUL plan after 12 weeks of SL5x5.

Fitness,b7bvcv,"I'm running in a bunch of obstacle and trail races this year. I've been lifting off and on for 3 years after being obese and losing the weight through proper diet. My muscular endurance sucks and I struggle to do more than 2 proper pushups, which is why I've started taking gym classes like Les Mills. My amateur routine looks like this:

Monday - stairclimber + Les Mills BodyPump (full body high rep weights/bodyweight stuff)

Tuesday - easy trail run +  yoga or Les Mills BodyFlow

Wednesday - speed work + Les Mills BodyPump/CxWorx (full body high rep plus core focus)

Thursday - easy trail run + potential ""power day"" (low rep big lifts)

Friday - total rest

Saturday - long trail run + yoga

Sunday - walk + specific obstacle work (dead hangs, burpees, pulling things, carries, etc.)

Right now, I'm doing all of this except the ""power day"" and it feels pretty good. My goals right now are to lose my last 40 lbs by October (calories/water/protein/sleep are on point, already lost some), beat my race PRs and fail fewer obstacles (I'm already running faster than last year), and to increase weight by no specified amount in what I consider ""big lifts"": bench, squat, deadlift, OHP, barbell rows.

My questions are: 

\- Are these goals realistic?

\- Is one day a week of high weight/low rep work enough to increase the weight on my big lifts?

\- What are some pitfalls I should look out for?

Due to my current living situation (apartment), lack of time, and money for a gym, I built a mini workout corner in my garage i.e. workout bench, bar, various sized weights. 

Call me lazy, but after work I just don't have the energy to do a full workout to sit there doing multiple sets. I've been doing just one set with as many reps as possible till I can't push myself further, so basically situps until I cant eek one more out, shoulders until I can't lift the weights properly etc. 

My question is, is this the least efficient method ever? I know it's definitely not the most efficient, but coming home from work and thinking of doing multiple sets seems too daunting for me at this point and I can't get motivated. Thinking of doing each muscle group just once seems easier for me to manage. Is this a total waste of time for me? I'm hoping that in the summer when my workload gets lighter I'll be able to do some normal regiment but right now I can't seem to get myself to do it and this is the only way I can get myself to workout.

So, almost exactly one year ago I made the decision to be consistent about my lifting routine and see how much I can achieve in a short timespan, naturally.

I started nSuns around May 2018, before I just did what I felt was right.

Lifts:

Bench - 275lbs

Squat - 350lbs

Deadlift - 420lbs(I think I struggled the most with this as I never really deadlifted before. Had trouble with form and even experienced back pain during summer that lasted for a few months but all is good now)

OHP - 175lbs


Before nSuns (roughly- I don’t remember exactly)

Bench: 190lbs

Squat: 240lbs

Deadlift: 240lbs

OHP: 130lbs

I go to the gym directly after work so that I don’t get lazy and skip.


Diet is not very strict. I aim for 130-140g of protein per day and do not count other macros. I try to lean bulk all the time, when I feel that I’m getting too fat I just cut down on the peanuts lol:

Breakfast: Banana, 6 slices of bread with peanut butter. Or 5 hard boiled eggs with 4 slices of bread.

While at work: 100-200 grams of peanuts with raisins, 400 grams of cottage cheese, banana

Dinner: anything really as long as it has decent protein and some veggies.

In the evening while chilling: some more peanuts, small snacks, juice (no, not steroids haha)

After reading this article, I was thinking of doing 20-30 minutes of LISS cardio on a treadmill. I exercise 3 days per week and would ideally perform this cardio 3-4 times per week with the goal of slowly increasing it to the 60-minute mark. I have a sedentary job, so the extra cardiovascular work would be welcomed. Because my lifting sessions are full body workouts that take 2-2.5 hours 3x per week, I'm not keen on the idea of spending another 30-60 minutes performing LISS cardio or even 15-20 mins of HIIT cardio 2x per week after the workouts due to historical issues with myself and recovery for my legs prior to performing squats.

Thinking back to when I was in college, all of the walking around on campus, back and forth, which had to have added up to a couple miles over the course of a day actually left me feeling more energetic in general and is something I don't quite feel today anymore.

Given that article that was providing a context for fat loss, which I also need (nutrition is in check), would these 3-4 20-30 minute rest-day LISS cardio walking sessions cause recovery issues for strength workouts? Have any of you experienced this?

I'm looking to start a new workout that I can do long term. I want something I can start small and progress through. I've tried the SL5x5 program before but I don't have access to the gym anymore like I used to with my new hours at my new job. I'm limited to doing my workouts from home, which has limited space. I don't have a garage and I don't have a basement. I do have a small screened porch which can store some equipment but not enough space for say a bench or lifting rack. Looking at the wiki and what looks appealing to me, I wanted to ask and see what you all thought about each program.

---  

Kettlebells:
I'm looking at either doing the Simple &amp; Sinister program or doing a Sports Style program. If I did Simple and Sinister I would do single kettlebell, but if I do Sport Style I would want to buy pairs of 2-3 different sizes in comp kettlebells.

Bodyweight Fitness:
I'm looking at doing the Reddit Recommended Routine, I have a pull up bar on my doorway. I'm looking at getting a TRX style suspension system to help with things like dips, l-sit, etc. and use that for going through the progressions.

---  

Both work for what I want to do, progression workouts I can do long term and can do at home with limited space. I'm not looking to get super shredded but I want to be in shape and maybe getting toned would be a good side effect. What I'm asking for is advice on what each program will do for me long term. I know S&amp;S is more about strength where Sport Style Kettlebells is more about endurance. I think Sport Style KB would be good, but I can't find a well organized program like S&amp;S. There are a lot of resources for the BWF RR Routine, but I'm not sure if I would benefit more from Kettlebells. My new job's health plan gives me up to $800/year for fitness expenses either a gym membership or buying my own gear to do at home. So I'm thinking I can get quite a few Kettlebells, lifting belt, etc. I'm also open to using that money to do something completely different, but I'm not sure what else I can do with limited space.

Fitness,b6xwc1,"Hey everyone, sorry for the long post, I'm feeling so demotivated and I would appreciate any insight.

About a year ago, I went on a lean bulk to put on some size and just recently transitioned to cutting about a month ago. During both the bulking and cutting phases, I've tracked my weight and body fat percentage daily (using one of those body analyzer scales). I know that's not an accurate way to determine body fat, but theoretically, it should at least be consistently inaccurate.

At the start of my bulk, I was 151 lbs, 12.4% body fat. At the end of the bulk (aka the beginning of my cut), I was 177.4 lbs 17.4% body fat.

During my cut, my calorie deficit such that I've been losing 1-1.5% body weight (not lean mass, body weight) a week, which I've been told was pretty standard. I've been eating 1.1g of protein per lb of body weight, I've minimized my fat intake to around 21-22% of my calorie intake, and the rest of my calories come from carbs. I haven't changed my training. I train each body part twice a week using the same volume and weight.

Here's the issue though. As I've been tracking my fat loss, it appears as though I'm just reversing all the progress I made during the bulk.

Here are examples of weights and bodyfats that I've encountered during the bulk and during the cut:

-Bulk: 172.8lbs, 16.5% body fat.
-Cut: 172.8 lbs, 16.5% body fat

-Bulk: 162.4lbs 13.3%
-Cut (Today when I weight myself): 162.4lbs and again, 13.3% body fat

This has been the case throughout the entirety of the cut. Whenever my bodyweight goes down to what it was before, the body fat is the same. Theoretically, if I'm preserving most of my muscle, my body fat should be lower at the same body weight. This suggests that I'm losing all the muscle that I built and not preserving nearly as much as I should.

Can anyone suggest why?

I've looked online and every website says the same thing. If you're losing muscle too fast, then you're:
1. Not eating enough protein
I am, 1.1g/lb body weight has been proven to be pretty much the most you should need on a cut

2. Not training with the same weight
I am

3. Cutting too fast
1-1.5% body weight/week is generally accepted as a good rate of loss, which is what I'm doing

4. Not sleeping enough
My sleep isn't great, but it's not like I'm running on 4 hours of sleep a day, and I feel like mediocre sleep shouldn't be hindering my progress this much


Does anyone know what's going on? Any advice would be great, because right now, I'm feeling incredibly demotivated.

I was upset and still weak at 167 and decided to just cut back to a clean slate. I went back down over time to around 149 and have tried bulking since then. This time around though at 2300 I was barely maintaining my weight. I bumped it up to 2450 calories and sat there for a while, then only gained around the 155lbs area + or - 5 lbs depending on the time of the day. After not losing or gaining on that much I bumped up to 2500-2550 give or take. I’ve been eating this much for around 3 weeks now and still sit in that very awkward 150-155 range. Shall I just stick with it or maybe up it again? This is make first time trying to do a lean bulk and am really having trouble gauging weight gain. Additionally, I am incredibly confused as to how I am eating so much more now yet maintaining a lower weight.

Fitness,b6s0kj,"Hello,

I did StrongLifts for 9 months, then switched to PHUL after reading about the workout routines here. I did it for a few months, made some changes as I go, and took a break for about 2 months. A workout generally took 2-2.5 hours for me (I still had 1-2 exercises left sometimes. I'm on the slower side.) 

I want to get back to the gym now, but I'd like to make some changes to the program to 

1. keep the workouts at 1-1.5 hours range, 
2. focus more on the upper body and arms (I really need to work on it; a gym owner who watched me do a few full workouts told me that my upper body was holding me back from lifting heavier weights during squats, which I agree with.)

I was wondering which exercises would be safe to remove from the plan to keep the workouts shorter, and which exercises I could add to focus more on the upper body. (Should I do 2 sets instead of 3 for some exercises? Also, I am OK with adding upper body exercises to lower body workouts for time). Below is my current modified version of PHUL.

**Workout 1: Upper power**

* Bench press (barbell, 3x5)
* Incline bench press (dumbbell, 3x6)
* Bent over row (yates, barbell, 3x5)
* Lat pulldown (machine, 3x6)
* Overhead press (barbell, 3x5)
* Bicep curl (barbell, 3x6)
* Skullcrusher (barbell, 3x6)
* Reverse fly (machine, 3x6) **=&gt; Added for upper back.**

**Workout 2: Lower power**

* Squat (barbell, 3x5) =&gt; I feel like I always have problems doing squats. I'm more comfortable with deadlifts, and I made decent progress I think. Not so much with squats.
* Deadlift (barbell 3x5)
* Leg press (machine, 3x10)
* Leg curl (machine, 3x6)
* Seated calf raise (machine, 3x6)

**Workout 3: Upper hypertrophy**

* Incline bench press (barbell, 3x12)
* Chest fly (dumbbell, 3x10)
* Seated row (machine, 3x12)
* Bent over one arm row (dumbbell, 3x10)
* Lateral raise (dumbbell, 3x12)
* Incline curl (dumbbell, 3x12)
* Triceps extension (machine, 3x12)
* Seated palms up wrist curl (barbell or dumbbell, 3x12) **=&gt; Added for forearms**

**Workout 4: Lower hypertrophy**

* ~~Front squat~~ **=&gt; Removed because I don't feel comfortable doing it.**
* Lunge (barbell, 3x12 each side)
* Leg extension (machine, 3x12)
* Leg curl (machine, 3x12)
* Seated calf raise (machine, 3x12)
* ~~Standing calf raise~~ **=&gt; Removed because my forearms are holding me back.**
* Calf press on leg press machine (3x12) **=&gt; Added as a replacement for standing calf raise.**

Stats:

* 33 yo male, 5'11"" and 180 lbs
* Goal: Aesthetics; I'd like to gain weight and muscle mass.
* Other physical activities: Distance running 2-3 times a week, 3 ab exercises at work every week day (60 second plank, 60 second side plank each side, bottom ups 10+ reps.)

Fitness,b6jvxc,"Should you be trying to progress on every exercise you do every week? Or just really focus on the main compound exercises? 

Say it's back day and someone does 5 exercises 4 sets each: deadlift, barbell rows, pull-ups, pullovers and chest supported rows (just made this up) should we be trying to progess (another set or more reps or increase the weight) the following week on ALL exercises? Or just focus on progressing in the deadlift? Or maybe deadlift and barbell rows? 

How does changing the order of exercises effect your ability to track progressive overload? If one week you do an exercise first in your workout and then the following week last (due to equipment availability or whatever) surely you will have less strength. 

Do you guys keep training logs of every single set/rep you guys do? I personally hate doing that, I just enjoy hitting the weights and not having to worry about recording eveeything, but I feel like it's necessary if I want to start making better progress. Anybody else hate doing it but find a way to make it more bearable? Or do you just have a general idea of when you're progressing and don't feel the need to keep a log? 

I've been working out for quite a while and although it's somewhat apparent that I do, I feel like I've severely limited my gains from not consistently trying to progress every single week and keep a strict training log.

* Preparing for a bodybuilding Photoshoots 
* No serious injuries
* I tried intermittent fasting, and dehydrating for my last photoshoot for the first time and worked well. My fat loss currently hit a plateau at ~21%

I keep a food journal and the last 4 weeks have averaged 125g Protein, 65g Fat, 75g carbs. Fasted  cardio 2 mornings a week. Rotate between weight lifting and HIIT on evenings 5 days a week. I do intermittent 16/8 hour fasting a few days a week as well. I workout frequently so I’m not sure if I’m too low on calories during this cut but I’m not seeming to lose anymore fat.

I wanted to know more about prepping and dehydrating before an event. I do amateur bodybuilding and have already researched how to prepare for a competition.

A few months ago, I had a photoshoot that required competition style prepping with dehydrating. This was totally doable since the photoshoot was only for a day and I could have time afterward to rehydrate and reintroduce carbs slowly over the weeks following. The dehydration, carb depletion, and fasting I did worked. 

However, I have a week of photoshoots planned with several photographers. I obviously can’t stay dehydrated for a whole week. My biggest concern is holding on to excess water weight and glycogen.

So yeah, title. This isn't an actual problem, but I'm wondering at this point if this is normal.

When I started I err on very low weights. I started my Deadlifts with something along the lines of 90lbs so I did not mind the lack of ""burn"". My current my 1RM on DL is 235 and It makes no sense that I don't ""feel"" it.

When doing my heavy compounds I do not feel the lactic acid burn in the zone I'm working. I do not even feel the worked muscles tired or aching until the next day. *They are very tired* alright, but I don't notice it until I try to do something, like lifting my legs after Squatting.

I can tell I'm about to reach failure for how much effort I have to put into pushing a rep or the speed of it. Not because I feel my chest burning or anything. I'm sweating like crazy, heart is racing, etc. all that is expected... but not pain. That sweet accomplishing pain of lactic acid I only get when pushing an isolated excersice into a +15reps sets done fast.

Could be rationalized that the low reps do not accumulate lactic acid as there is enough oxygen supply in the tissue and the flow takes away the cellular waste before it makes me feel the sensation I'm expecting.

Fitness,b6je32,"If you aren't familiar with the program, it's a 5/3/1+ routine where you then deload X lbs every additional set where you're doing 3,3,3,5,5,5+ reps or 3/5/3/5/3/5+ for a total of 9 sets. However, this does not include warm ups.

For some reason, even after warming up I found it difficult to make X lb increments for my next set from 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 1 but I found that every set thereafter became easier and easier. I know the weight goes down after your AMRAP 1+ set, but there is a point where you repeat your 5 rep set and your 3 rep set. I find the secondary sets easier than the first 2 sets and I wonder why?

So I decided one week to do the program backwards. That is I would start at the lowest weight and increment by X lbs until I reached my 1+ AMRAP set then dropped X pounds for the next 2 sets (5/3). The workout felt considerably easier this way and I didn't feel as though my 1+ AMRAP set suffered. Is there a downside to running the program this way? I mean the volume is technically the same.

In case all of the above is confusing, I will give an example below:

|Set|Standard|Backwards|

The talking points Paul Covers

* Not keeping a training log

* Training ADD

* Picking poor exercises

* Focusing on insignificant details

* Not knowing how to train hard

* Focusing too much on social media

* Losing sight of what is important



These are mistakes I observe constantly through the daily thread and other posts here and across other parts of reddit.  They're ones I've been guilty of as well.

Fitness,b68joh,"Hey all,

So during the summer break, two friends and I are going to be attending boxing classes 3x a week (I assume between 90 and 120 mins).

I have some pretty basic experience in said area, as I do (Nihon/Japanese) Jujitsu and we cover all major sparring styles (grappling, judo, kickboxing and of course boxing).

And although I am soon to be a green belt, I am still pretty insecure about my ""boxing"".

Hence, my friends and I decided it would be great to do one last activity together before we all go our seperate ways; or well, they leave me for the same university :(

Anyway, I am passively putting together a plan, I am currently orientating my training around the intent to join the British army in September of 2020, but a few months of this new training style might just do me good (both a mental and a physical break from my current training style for a bit).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I was hoping to gain some insight of how people who orientate their workouts/training plan around boxing.

&amp;#x200B;

* How often do you box?
* How often do you run?
* How often do you lift?
* How often do you train abs + core?
* How often do you rest?
* Do you do plyometrics?
* Do you swim regularly?
* How do you become more agile (for boxing)?
* How do you become more flexible (for boxing)?

&amp;#x200B;

* Are there any resources/channels you would recommend me check out?

&amp;#x200B;

I was really just hoping to do a sort of boot camp for boxing for myself, just to become the best I can possibly be with the time I have before returning to Jujitsu. Considering my current level, I can imagine that I can make a significant improvement to my sparring and coordination, any tips and tricks to reach my goals I would be glad to read.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers in advanced.

Fitness,b6dprl,"Hi, 21 year old, 5'10 12% body fat 130 pound guy with mild GI distress issues. Currently trying to figure those out but let me give you some insight as to what was happening to me prior.   


I go to the gym 4 - 5 times a week and workout about 2 hours at a time. (Half of that being rest)  


I had issues, switched to keto, issues seemed fixed until I added more olive oil in the mix, issues got worse, switched to zero-carb as that ""ultimate elimination"" crap, issues got better and then got worse as I tried to do the paleo-medicina Paleo-Ketogenic diet (""whole foods"" organs, meats and fats only). I found a cycle where every time I tried upping fat, as the protocol requires you to have a 2:1 fat:protein ratio PER GRAM (totaling out to 80% fat 20% protein MINIMUM) I kept feeling more and more ill in my stomach but not mentally. Ironically psychologically and semi-physically I was actually feeling better, more energy, needed less sleep and felt more alert all around.   


So now I'm back on the SAD, I want to know however what I should eat regularly to be able to put on weight and actually gain mass, I recorded myself on cronometer and given I'm currently mildly wary for vegetables and LOTS of different types of grains due to anti-nutrients, I'm curious as to what I should be eating or what people here would recommend to eat for a bulk.

I am a 29 year old male, 5´11"" currently 180 lbs with an estimated 20-24% body fat based on the navy body fat calculator. I have been in my weight loss journey since September of 2017 and started at 242lbs. At first I was only changing my diet to whole foods and counting macros, about 2-3 months ago I started weight training doing stronglifts 5x5 program.

I have made decent progress on the program but feel like I am ""wasting potential"" due to doing a linear progression program while at a deficit. My goal is to get to at least 15% body fat and then start to clean bulk to make some mass gains.I currently feel like I am losing weight at an extremely slow pace approximately 0.3lbs a week if any loss at all. 

My question is involving a routine swap, I have access to P90X which is a lot more cardio focused than I currently am working on. Would it be wise to swap to p90x and do it for 3 months to try to push through this last 5-8% body fat so I can start my bulk and actually be able to progress on a strength program? Or should I stick to the strength focused program and possibly take even longer to get to my bulking phase?

I am currently eating around 1800 calories a day, I don't feel comfortable dropping any lower than this and have tried to up my workouts to create the deficit needed. I am worried that if I do P90X I could lose the strength gains I have made, but at the same time I am worried that doing just the strength training is causing me to stall at my current body fat percentage while the deficit makes me unable to gain the strength needed to progress further.

Fitness,b5fbyk,"I've struggled with ongoing depression for a while now and about a year ago it got really bad, I was seriously contemplating suicide and that thought alone made me very scared. I felt like I had no one to care about and nothing to care about. I was small, weak, played video games all day and had stopped caring for my health. Simply put, life wasn't great. I'd always been teased about being skinny, mostly from my family. They liked to criticize me on my frail appearance. Anyways, one day as I was browsing reddit I stumbled across the beginners guide in this particular sub and I remember thinking to myself: 'that doesn't look so hard. I bet I could do it.' I'm not sure what clicked in my head; maybe I was tired of all the verbal abuse or maybe I just needed a reason to get out of the house. Whatever the reason, I decided to give it a shot, to try going to the gym. I got off my ass and headed to the nearest 24 hr gym I could find (I wanted it to be a 24hr gym because then I could go very early and be on my own, unjudged) I talked to the manager and signed up for a 1 week trial.
I'm not going to lie, the first day there I felt like an idiot, I went in at 4 am thinking that no one would be there and to my surprise the gym was full of none other than cops (probably training before their shift started). Seeing the cops made me very frightened but I pushed through it and got my first ever workout in. I explicitly remember bringing a piece of paper with me where I had hand drawn all the exercises with stick figures so I could remember how to do them. Even with my notes, I sucked, big time. But something made me want to see how much I could lift, how far I could push myself and eventhough my entire body hurt after the workout I got up the next morning, again, at 4am an walked into the gym.
From that point on I've been hooked, I love the gym, I love powerlifting, I love it all. And even though I'm still not great and my numbers are fairly average, I love walking in every day and seeing myself slowly get better. 
To this day, I still struggle with depression, especially recently after my S.O and I broke up, but at least now I have a rock to rely on, an activity that no matter what, I know I'll enjoy and be happy with.

After around 6 months I stopped going to failure and increased my volume and had better results. Then I switched to doing upper/lower body workouts and split my total volume in 2 workout sessions. The problem is that I didn't feel like I was doing enough during my workout session because my muscles didn't feel fatigued enough so I started increasing my volume too much and ended burning myself out.  


Now my question is this: Is it worth going back to training each muscle group twice a week if you've been working out for almost 2 years? If it is how should I go about splitting up my routine and how can I gest past this feeling that if I don't have serious DOMS the next day it means that I didn't push myself enough?

I'm fortunate that I am provided with breakfast and dinner during weekdays of 1st year of uni

Here's what an average day looks like:

Breakfast - Eggs, sausages, beans with some toast and cranberry juice (600 calories)

\- on weekends I just have 100g oats mixed with 400ml whole milk with some frozen fruit (600 calories)

Lunch - I usually have a huge lunch, some sort of carbohydrate usually tortilla wraps/rice/wholegrain pasta with protein such as more eggs/chicken/mince beef and eat with a bowl of mixed vegetables with some kind of salad dressing or sauce, I then wash this down with a [gainer shake](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/2dxt4q/share_your_high_calorie_shake_reciepes/cju50iq) (overall lunch total 2000 calories)

sometimes I am too full to drink the shake so I drink it in the evening instead

Dinner - again served by the uni usually some sort of carb and protein with random items from the salad bar (I usually get some couscous/pasta salad mix - for the extra carbs ;) ) and some desert (total - usually around 700 calories minimum)

Snack - Banana or sometimes 400ml of whole milk when the days caloric intake is fairly low (100-550 calories)

Also supplements I take are: Whey protein, creatine, omega 3 fish oil and vitamin D tablets

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on continuing this bulk until the end of the year lowkey wanna hit 95kg - 100kg bodyweight, after which I'll probably go on a cut. I'm planning on doing another progress post by end of the year or next summer, hopefully all goes well :)

As a 6ft 2, 102kg male my BMI is 28.8, which is 1.2 points away from obese. Since I've been weight training a number of years I tend to ignore BMI so started looking into body fat percentage.

I have had my BF% calculated in a couple of different ways which put it in the 15-20% range. Room for improvement but overall not too bad.

If at 100kg I have 17kg of fat that's 17% body fat, which is generally considered to be an OK level. If by some miracle I manage to bulk to 110kg without putting on any fat or say bulk/cut to that point. My bodyfat percentage would drop to 15% which is reasonably lean but I'd still have 17kg of fat on my body.

Due to the change in body fat percentage it would be considered healthier but the amount of body fat has not changed. Does this mean by gaining muscle mass you negate negative impacts of body fat? Or just at higher body weights a higher proportion of your body weight can be fat? Or is this just a problem with using body fat percentage to look at health?

I appreciate fat isn't inherently bad but leaning down from 17-15% would probably be considered to be healthier

I have been doing hypertrophy training tuesday and thursday while on wednesday and friday have been MMA training. The person I do the hypertrophy with said that in order not to ""ruin"" the gain of tuesday and thursday if I do my usual HIITS it should be sunday.

My question is if I should just keep doing that or if I can incorporate instead of HIIT doing some running even mid week (around 10kms runs) on days that I don't have the hypertrophy training  (although I read its also possibly doing the running well before the training doesn't affect it?).

EDIT: my goals are to gain more muscle overall while losing body fat percentage at the same time which I have been told can be difficult since usually hypertrophy means eating more to gain more mass ( from what I read ), I have currently been eating less on non hypertrophy training days (my maintenance calories should be around 2000 so on those days I aim for 1500 and on those training days I eat a bit more before the trainings of carbs), which is why I also wanted to incorporate some cardio to lose the fat.

Due to a really busy schedule, I don't have much time to go to the gym. I thought of buying some dumbbells and do my workout at home, but that would restrict me from doing the big compound lifts, so I thought about combining these two ideas.

Basically, I'd like to buy a set of light/moderately heavy dumbbells and do only the accessory exercises at home (e.g l. Lateral raises, curls, triceps extension etc) for 2-3 times a week and only go once a week to the gym and do the compound exercises (bench press, weighted pull-ups and deadlifts).

Would such a workout be effective? I found that would be the best workaround so far. 

I am at an intermediate level regarding fitness. Been going to the gym for about 2 years and I'm a 23 y/o guy in average-good shape.

-	Hanging leg raises


*Day 3 (Home):*

-	Pistol Squats (+weighted)/Shrimp squats
-	Bulgarian split squats
-	Push-ups (+variations)
-	Abs Wheel Rollouts


*Notes:*
- I prefer the pistol squat over the barbell squat, that's why I didn't include it in the gym day;
- The workout is not split into muscle groups, it's more of a full body workout with a focus on different muscle groups, depending on the day - my goal is to be able to work each muscle group at least twice a week;",Going to the gym once a week and doing accessory work at home,timetracker7,1553593365.0,1,0

Fitness,b5le6b,"TL;DR: I have bolded the questions amongst the wall of text if you quickly wanted to see them with some surrounding context. Basically I'm a 20 year old 5'9"" male currently at 150 lbs. My questions are:

1. I'm eating 140g of protein while cutting with 1700 calories (TDEE 2400). When I bulk with about 2600 calories will the excess protein hurt me? It's going to rise to nearly 200 I would imagine. 
2. I read that a cut for me should be 2200 calories, but I feel fine eating 1700. Am I doing something wrong? I don't feel overly tired, I'm still progressing on my lifts as the program directs.
3. I feel like I have a lot to progress on my bench, but I'm not sure I can progress my deadlift at the same rate. Meaning my deadlift progress is going to stall way before my bench. How do I know when to start bulking? If I can't progress on a few exercises but can on others should I continue the former at the same weight as I increase the latter until they stall? Or should I just start the bulk? 
4. After I get to where I want by the end of this journey, is maintaining truly as simply as continuing to exercise with the same weights every session and to just get enough protein? Can I be less strict on what I eat as long as i get in the protein?

Hello! 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided two months ago in late January that I wanted to start going to the gym so I can get toned and muscular. After reading the wiki and learning about all the ins and outs of a healthy lifestyle I think I developed a solid plan to get to where I want to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 5'9"" male and I am 20 years old. I have used the TDEE calculator on IIFYM and have come to an estimate of about 2400. I follow have been following Metallicdpas program religiously and being a college student I walk about five miles a day and play basketball on Sundays. I started at 160 pounds and am now 150 lbs as of this morning ([graph of my weight](https://imgur.com/a/Qv6KctB) since mid February - didn't get a scale until then but I know my weight was 160 prior to this). My lean body weight is 130lbs.  I eat 1700 calories a day, which I feel like that seems low after lurking on this sub for a bit. **I read that a cut for me should be 2200 calories, but I feel fine eating 1700. Am I doing something wrong? I don't feel overly tired. I'm still progressing on my lifts as the program directs, I feel a little hungry by the end of the day but that is normal on a cut I thought?**

 However, everything I eat is measured out so I know for a fact that the number is accurate. Here is a picture from myFitnessPal showing [my calories and macros](https://imgur.com/a/nnlOcCP). Basically I am eating 140g protein, 180g of carbs and 50g of fat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a breakdown of what my main lifts look like now as opposed to when I started: 

&amp;#x200B;

|Exercise |Starting Working Weight/(sets/reps) |Current Working Weight(lbs)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Deadlift|95lbs (1x5)|215lbs (1x5)|
|Bench Press|55lbs (5x5)|105lbs (5x5) |
|Overhead Press|45lbs (5x5)|75lbs (5x5)|
|Back Squats|75lbs (5x5)|170lbs (5x5)|
|Barbell Row|75lbs (5x5)|130lbs (5x5)|

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to cut for the summer either until I get down to at the most 140lbs, or until my progress stalls out.  Hoping to start my lean bulk in September and then bulk until 165. I really am not sure about what weight I want to bulk to, I just will know visually when to stop I suppose. My aim isn't to get absolutely massive, just get gain a bit more size in areas I feel are small like my arms and chest. **I know it may be a bit tough to answer but does 165 seem like a number that fits that goal?**  Finally I will cut until I am toned and eat at a maintenance. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now after that wall of text, I have a few questions. As I understand it, in order to bulk I should be eating at most likely around 2600 calories (my TDEE may change as my weight drops so this may fluctuate a bit). **My worry about eating nearly 1,000 more calories is will eating so much excess protein hurt me?** If I am eating 140g now, with 1000 more calories I am bound to be near 200g. I know my fats and carbs will definitely increase and I know bulking will cause me to inevitably gain fat so I'm not too worried there, but again what will the excess protein do? As for starting my bulk, I feel as though at my current size, some exercises are going to stall earlier than others. For example, I feel like I have a lot to progress on my bench, but I'm not sure I can progress my deadlift at the same rate. Meaning my deadlift progress is going to stall way before my bench. **How do I know when to start bulking? If I can't progress on a few exercises but can on others should I continue the former at the same weight as I increase the latter until they stall? Or should I just start the bulk?** I have a specific picture in my head of where I want to be and how I want to look by the end of this journey. I know once I get there I continue exercising and eating enough protein to stay at that form. **My question is; is it truly that simple? Once I get to where I want, I just stop progressing? Do I get to be less strict on what I eat as long as I get my protein in?**

Fitness,b5f4pu,"I've been doing some research and reading up on fitness routines of various different bodybuilding competitors. A lot of them mention doing weight training and then supplementing their training with 30-45 minutes of HIIT or LISS cardio daily to help them get and stay lean. I understand that when losing weight it's important to be at a caloric deficit and too large of a deficit and overtraining can have the opposite effect by slowing down your metabolism and forcing the body to retain fat, hence why a lot of folks recommend losing 1lb of bodyweight per week at -500 calories from your daily TDEE.

Could someone explain the mentality behind this style of training? Does it actually help them lose weight by putting them at a greater deficit in which case why is their metabolism not effected? **Why train more instead of just eating less?** (I know some bodybuilders have very limited calories but a lot of the ones I came across had plenty of calories to play around with so I don't understand the ideology) Does the increased amount muscle mass raise their metabolism enough to not be impacted? Does it simply allow for them to eat more food during their training? Just trying to expand my knowledge.

Fitness,b5an7c,"So I’ve been working to shed some pounds over the last several months. For some quick background, I lifted heavy throughout high school/college and most of the time through graduate school. Towards the end of grad school, the stress was really getting to me and dealt with it through food and booze.  I’m 5’7.5”  and at the peak of that phase, went up to 212.  Finished the PhD, got life moving in the right direction, and managed to shed most of it. Last March, I was around 183 and decided to get more serious back in the gym to shed the last of it.  I’ve been in a minor caloric deficit and had been making steady progress, finally making it down to 171 in January, which was my high school wrestling weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s where my question comes in. During that phase, I was working out at Planet Fitness, doing the best I could with their limited heavy weights/free weights. Towards the end of January, I finally switched to a real gym and have been going heavy on a 5-6 day PPL split (depending on weekly schedule), and focusing on heavy bench/squat/deadlifts and getting my lift numbers back up to what they used to be. Since then, and keeping all other aspects the same, my weight has jumped right back up to 177-182. Now, I’m more concerned with the mirror than the scale, but still, this has been frustrating!

&amp;#x200B;

I’m also big on cardio, and incorporate circuit training (i.e. 20 min hard resistance spin bike/jump rope alternates, etc.), long-ish trail runs, and mountain biking now that the weather is warming. I’m hoping to get a DEXA scan soon, but I’d estimate that I’m around 18%. I’ve always naturally carried a lot more muscle on my frame than the average person. My goal is to get down to 13-14%. Abs would be great, but not a requirement. Just want the rest of this stubborn belly and lower back fat to disappear.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve had some trouble with macro calculators with being unsure how I should adjust for activity levels. I was keto for a while in the beginning of weight loss and they always said keep it at sedentary, others say differently. I still eat lower carb and my current job has me on my feet constantly, averaging 10,000 steps daily, in addition to my workouts. I don’t add calories back from any cardio I do. I religiously tracked calories all last year. Have been a bit more lax recently since having a much better idea with estimating calories, and during this time have avoided foods that are easy to underestimate like nuts/nut butters.

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea what the spontaneous weight gain is from? While I could see 2-3 pounds coming from being lax on tracking, I know I haven’t gained 8-10 pounds of fat or 8-10 lbs of muscle.

Before I start off with my questions, here are basic details about myself:

* Male
* 22M
* Height: 160 CM / 5.2""
* Weight: 78.5 KG / 173 LBS (Dropped from **81 KG** since I started the program)
* Body Fat %: 27.5
* Muscle %: 29.9
* Routine Start Date: **11th February 2019** (Almost 2 months)
* Diet: I am eating a **calorie deficit** right now which has brought my total calories to **1200** where I eat whatever but mostly focus on eating protein (TDEE was around 1700 something)
* Exercises: Currently following the Stronglifts 5x5 program as I am a beginner and cutting right now. My current numbers are as follows:  
**Squat = 67.5 KG / 148.8 LBS** (I have stalled once at 62.5 KG but then climbed back up after reducing 10%)  
**Bench Press = 42.5 KG / 93.7 LBS** (Stalled in the last 2 workouts at 42.5 KG but then today I managed to push through today)  
**Barbell Row = 22.5 KG / 49.6 LBS** (I recently dropped my weight to 20 KG / 44 LBS again to fix my form, prior to the drop it was 40 KG / 88.1 LBS)  
**Overhead Press = 25 KG / 55 LBS** (This is my weakest lift so far, I recently dropped 10% cause I stalled for three workouts consecutively)  
**Deadlift = 40 KG / 88.1** (I recently dropped my weight to fix my form, prior to the drop it was 65 KG / 143 LBS)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I have gotten all my details out the way, here are my issues and questions:

1. At my current squat weight, I am unable to do **5x5.** I had to reduce it to **3x5** today because I was too tired to do **5x5**. Is this okay or should I consider it a fail and try to repeat the same weight again next time?
2. At my current weight and body fat % I am considered obese so I am working hard to get **lean (&gt;20% body fat)** and **drop my weight to 60 KG** while trying my best to maintain muscle by lifting heavy. Is this a realistic goal to achieve by the end of 2019 with my current regiment? What improvements would you suggest?
3. In terms of my lifts, I am not sure if I am being realistic so I would love some feedback. I am hoping that my lift numbers will be as follows by the end of 2019 in relation to my body weight:  
OHP: 1x  
Bench: 1.5x  
Squat: 2x  
Deadlift: 2.5x
4. Would I be able to see some **changes in my body physically** by the end of 2019 following this regimen?

Sorry for the long post, I rarely post here but thought it would best to ask people who know more than me.

Fitness,b56suy,"Hi r/Fitness. 

I'm an 18 year old male who's on the skinny side and one of my goals this year is to gain weight. I've been lightly going to the gym since high school (I'm a first year university student), but I never found I could stick to it. I've been looking for other options and other sports to gain weight and I think I've finally settled on swimming.

I've read some threads on [bodybuilding.com](https://bodybuilding.com) and asked a couple of friends if trying to swim to earn mass is an ideal way to gain weight, and from what I've gathered it seems to be that it's not the best method of doing so. One of the biggest reasons is apparently swimming is more of a cardiovascular exercise than it is a muscle/strengthening exercise(?).

I'm here to ask if it's possible to gain some size by swimming. It's a sport I genuinely love doing but I do have a goal in mind that I'm working towards and I'd love to get to that point.

So I am trying to do the none optimal thing of bulking while losing weight.

Fitness,b4xrao,"EDIT - I'll see if I can calculate my TDEE with myfitnesspal and see the results. Unfortunately, the app is not logging in but I'll look into it

&amp;#x200B;

For the past two months, I have been struggling to lose just the last bit of fat that I want to lose (to be more specific, just a few more inches on my waist which are stubbornly resilient to almost everything that I tried to do so far).

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, this has been going on back and forth with little progress or there come those two days of what seems to be a bit of progress but all of a sudden, my body just goes back to where it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I have been told repeatedly that I still lost weight or still look like I lost weight even though my measurements (weight and chest, waist, and hip measurments) stayed roughly the same (although I would say roughly, open close inspection of my body, I have to say that they had a point because I do look a bit thinner than I was 2 months ago and even my clothes say that as well because they feel bigger). It does not make any sense but the information does not lie (and it is very possible that I look more thin than before because of the lower glycogen levels because of the lower amount of carbs in my diet)

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have tried plenty of things (and I am also still learning about the right diet and workout plan) - I changed my diet a little bit, kept my TDEE at a calorie deficit, made sure that I got the adequate amount of protein and fats but less carbs, tried to calculate every meal that I cooked (although I do admit that I had the occasional cheat meal or cheat day and I will get to that a bit). I took this very diligently but I still feel like I have not managed just yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only that, but the cravings are incredibly strong. Almost every day, it is as if I am anticipating for the next meal (not exactly hungry but just really anticipating it or craving it) and sometimes, just to keep my mind sane and focused, I sort of ""cheated"" or used the IIFYM approach to make sure that I stayed on track but it was not the first time (this mostly happens on weekends) where I just did not care about my TDEE or any of the macro calculations and just eat what I desired, sometimes even had seconds right after a meal like a big plate of pasta or a few more slices of biscuits.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that cravings, desire for the occasional pizza or burger or whatever guilty pleasure food is common especially when you are on a strict diet or on the cutting phase. This happens almost every day and I try to compensate for this.

&amp;#x200B;

But despite this and despite how I keep on realising that week after week or after every two weeks, my weight and measurements stayed almost the same (give or take a half inch or an inch here and there), I am still told that I look like I lost weight (perhaps muscle mass) and I am realising that that seems to be the case after I thoroughly inspected almost everything that I could think of to confirm this - before and after pictures, how my clothes fit, my neck circumference, relying on the comments of people who are professional about this and so on (and not the same that the craving are persisting constantly)

&amp;#x200B;

I find this very baffling as it does not seem to make sense but somehow this is actually happening.

Fitness,b509ea,"Current Stats: 

* Age: 24
* Sex: male
* Height/weight: 5'8""/172 lb
* Body fat %: 23.5% 
* Lift numbers 5x5: bench press 135, deadlift 225, squat 165

I have been messing around for about 2 years lifting without any good results (except I went from about 80-135 bench and similar sad results on other lifts). My main issue starting as a skinny-fat is that I couldn't get myself to commit to bulking or cutting. I have been trying to achieve like 10 goals at once in all the workout plans I have setup in the past (using Stronglifts, 5/3/1, GZCLP) and ended up accomplishing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

It stops today (two weeks ago). **This time I have exactly 2 goals: lower my BF% to 18% and get to 10 body weight pullups.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my routine:

1. Monday: 
   1. 15 minutes rowing machine HIIT (after warmup/cooldown, 20 minutes total)
   2. 8/5/3 bench press. This follows 5/3/1, except using 8/5/3 after a trainer recommended because I was stalling on BP.
   3. 5x5 assisted pullups (thinking of changing to some unassisted, and more reps assisted)
   4. 8/5/3 squats super set with 5x10 bicep curls (to save time)
2. Tuesday/Th:
   1. 15 minutes stairmaster HIIT
   2. 5x5 straight arm pulldown
   3. 15 minutes HIIT with a kettlebell swing
   4. 5x8 dips
   5. 5x12 shoulder raises
3. Wednesday:
   1. Repeat Monday, swap BP with deadlifts and squats with OHP.
4. Friday: 
   1. Repeat Monday, swap BP with bent-over barbell row. Keep squats.

&amp;#x200B;

My concerns:

1. Am I benching enough? If so, should I (A) swap T/Th shoulder raises for dumbbell or incline press (might be hard after dips), or (B) swap the Friday squats with more bench? Is benching once a week+dips twice a week enough?
2. An exercise physician thinks this is too intense. I am sore all the time when I do this. He thinks I don't get enough recovery time. Is he right? Should I take T/Th out completely or do something less intense than 30 minutes of HIIT and some accessories?
3. After training with a lot of discipline but not a lot of focus (i.e., go to the gym and do everything, but only increase load when I feel ready to and not track goals very well), I feel like I didn't get the newbie gains I could have (I went from about 85-135 bench). Has the ship sailed on newbie gains? Should I be following the instructions designed for intermediate lifters who have to work harder to gain as much? Keep in mind I have a genetically lower muscle mass according to my doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

Diet: since two weeks I am following a high-protein, low-carb diet (50g carb/175g protein/ rest fats). I am fortunate to have a high-quality cafeteria for all three meals at my office where they post the nutrition info (which is also up on MyFitnessPal). My calorie limit is 2,000 kcal/day, but I don't hit it often because protein and fat are really filling. In the past week I average 1,860 kcal, 154g protein (two days where I didn't eat more than 1,200 kcal are dragging this down), and 51 carbs.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is this conducive to reducing body fat percentage to 18% in 12 weeks (calculated with keeping 97% of muscle mass and losing 1.3 lb weight/week)

Well since I train at home I never had a baseline to compare myself to. And just found this website that gives you a ballpark idea to where you should be depending on your gender, age, etc.. It's
https://strengthlevel.com.

I'm simply training to stay healthy in general so for me being Intermediate (basically average, 50%) is a good goal.

So.. Here is some of my results
Flat dumbell press, I can do 10x65pounds. Which puts me at stronger than 37% of lifters. ..which I find fine.. IM getting there.

Dumbell shoulder press I can do 7x40pounds, stronger than 12% of lifter. Oh well.. Shoulder has never been my strength, I have to admit they're probably my weakest part.

I can do 9 bodyweight pull ups, stronger than 34%, Im cool with that, when I started I couldn't do a single one. 

So far so good.. 
Now, the back. I find lots of rowing exercises I feel like Im pretty good. For example dumbbell row, I can do 9x70pounds which is stronger than 39%.

But last week I started doing deadlifts. I have avoided the exercise before because of a knee issue, any kind of squatting is really uncomfortable. But I kept reading how important this exercise is so I went in anyway since I figured the knee doesn't bend that much I should be fine. I watched tons of YouTube video to make sure I had perfect form, as I know form is especially important on any high compound movement. I experimented with the empty bar for a while, started loading the bar with 25s (95pounds total) and did 9-10reps, annnd that was enough for me, I was near failure, and nearly out pf breath. I kept thinking man it feels like I should be able to load more even as a beginner.. Thats when I googled some stuff and found the strengthlevel.com website. So where does that put me? Lol
 Stronger than 0% of lifter. It says a beginner should be able to do around 205.

Does any of you have a similar experience where you are extremely weak on a certain exercise? Does anyone have any idea why Im so weak deadlifting (btw im pretty confident my form is fine, not rounding my back, starting position my torso is at an angle (not flat), pushing with my legs, squeezing my glutes at the end, etc..)

Bench I started out at 20kg and recently did  35kg at 7 reps for my amrap.
 

Squats I started at 20kg, was fairly difficult which I assume is thanks to my own body weight and recently hit 40 kg with only 5 reps (although I had some pain in my legs which I got during a walk, not sure what happend but it was difficult to go 100%) - otherwise probably would have squeezed out another 2-3 reps. 


Can't do chins so doing pulldowns with underhand grip, currently doing 45kg with amrap 7.


Overhead Press I started out at 10kg and am now hitting 22.5kg with amrap 5. This one was alot tougher than I had thought.


For my deadlift I started out at 20kg, in hindsight it felt difficult cus it was so low on the ground and after getting some weights to move it closer it was alot easier to do. Currently at 45 kg with amrap 11 (my hands give out before the rest of my body). Gotten more than 10 reps for my amrap every time so I can probably go up to much higher but figure I should go a bit slow since I'm new and learning.


The reason I'm asking if it's too soon is because I can definitely continue adding weight with each session - would 5/3/1 still progress as well as GSLP does for a complete beginner?

## Link to the complete blog post here: https://antranik.org/pike-pushups/

As a fun experiment, I did Pike Pushups as the only progression exercise to see how many it would take to translate to a single Handstand Pushup (HSPU). I documented that entire journey in a 3 part series on my blog [here](https://antranik.org/tag/hspu/) and as I got intimately acquainted with this exercise, I put together all the things I learned along the way to help you succeed with it too! So in this post I will point out what is proper form &amp; how to set yourself up for consistency, so here goes!

###Pike pushups are more technical to setup and execute than expected

* Changing any single one variable can make the exercise seem a lot easier or harder so having a consistent setup is crucial for success. And because it’s a difficult exercise, it’s easy to do it with bad form without even realizing the body is taking shortcuts. 
* Some people find pike pushups so frustrating to master that they resort to doing the barbell equivalent, the overhead press, because they can incrementally increase the load on the bar with far fewer variables to deal with. I’m here to help you to not experience that frustration.

###Pike pushups done with proper form are deceptively hard.

* I mean like, *really* hard. It's very difficult to perform them with proper form. *So hard in fact that most demonstrations on YouTube are shown with poor form.* 

* **[GIF: Demonstration of Pike Pushup](https://gfycat.com/ifr/DimThirdIvorybilledwoodpecker)** 

#*Section 1: How to do Pike Pushups with Proper Form*

**Form Check #1: Just like with normal pushups, the elbows should not be flaring out to the sides**

* Since this is a progression exercise toward handstand pushups, it's important to note that a real handstand pushup will never be performed with the elbows flaring outwards. As such, during pike pushups, the forearms or elbows shouldn't be moving backwards or flaring out to the sides as well. They should remain vertical and fairly static.

* To facilitate this, turn the hands out slightly so the index finger faces forward. You can even make it more extreme so the thumb faces forward if your wrists are bothered.

* **[GIF: Bad Form / Good Form, Front View](https://gfycat.com/ifr/ElectricOddballFly)**

**Form Check #2: Your head should go MUCH MORE FORWARD than you think is enough**

* This is definitely the #1 offender of all: people dip their head down to go between their hands. No. Stop that. The head should not go down between your hands. The head should go *forward* and down. So far forward that your head ends up ahead of the fingers. So far forward that the elbows don't move backwards whatsoever but maybe they even go forward a teensy bit when you're even stronger. 

* When in doubt, go more ahead than you think you can. (In any harder variation, like a hollowback press or bent arm planche, your head will need to go even more forward.)

* **[GIF: Bad Form / Good Form, Side View](https://gfycat.com/ifr/ThisVacantFalcon)**

* What happens if you put your head straight down between the hands? The elbows flare out to the sides and it increases the strain on the elbow and shoulder joints. You'll be able to do more reps with this improper form, misleading you to think that you're stronger than you actually are. (Remember, this exercise is deceptively hard when done right.)

**Form Check #3: Your nose should touch the ground**

* Rather than aiming for the top of the head to touch the ground, have the nose touch it. You get more range that way.

**Form Check #4: Practice full range of motion (ROM)**

* This goes without saying. Press up until arms are straight and the shoulders are over the wrists.

#*Section 2: How To Set Yourself Up For Consistency*

**Setup Tip #1: Start with (Feet-Elevated) Decline Pike Pushups**

* Doing pike pushups with feet on the ground is OK but I suggest you start with decline pike pushups where the feet are slightly elevated. This will mitigate any hamstring flexibility issues and make the exercise feel less awkward.

* Even if the flexibility is not an issue, I highly recommend it. Also, one should be comfortable with regular pushups.

* If you have been doing pushups properly, [the way I recommend,](https://youtu.be/4dF1DOWzf20) then you have a solid base.

**Setup Tip#2: The hands should be about shoulder width apart**

* Setting the hands far wider than shoulder width will feel easier because there's less range of motion.
* Setting the hands narrower than shoulder width will feel very difficult and is an advanced variant.
* Keep the hands at around shoulder width apart for optimum range and intensity.

**Setup Tip #3: Choose an object you could elevate your feet on and stick to that height**

* I put my feet on a chair (about knee height) and did that for 6 weeks minimum before elevating the feet onto the couch (about hip height) and doing that for 6 weeks.

* **[Pic: Left: Feet elevated to knee height \(on a chair\) is about 77% of my bodyweight. Right: With feet at hip height \(on couch\), this is about 83% intensity.
](https://i.imgur.com/e3ywcH3.jpg)**

* The difference between the above settings for the feet is only ~6% which doesn't sound like much, but it is considering the chair-setting is already quite difficult at ~77% intensity so don't start at the highest possible setting. This exercise is humbling. The height of the feet should be the same for a while.

**Setup Tip #4: Place the feet near the edge of the platform**

* When I was using a chair, I would make sure my feet were placed right near the edge of the chair. If I placed the feet further back, toward the middle of the chair, the exercise would be far easier.

* When I elevated the feet to hip height, I was using the side of my couch. Luckily, arm-rest was narrow so I couldn't set my feet too far back or forth.)

**Setup Tip #5: If using a movable object to put your feet on, always place them in the same spot.**

* When I was using a chair, I would place the legs of the chair exactly at the edge of the carpet each and every time. Then, my feet would go at the end of the chair and my hands would go on the same spot on the carpet everytime. And finally, when doing the actual pushup, my nose would always hit the same spot on the carpet as well.

* **[GIF: Example of what constitutes a Consistent Setup](https://gfycat.com/ifr/PortlyImpureItalianbrownbear)**

**Setup Tip #6: Use a landmark for where your nose should touch for each and every rep.**

* Do this to ensure you're going forward enough. On the carpet, I chose a pattern to aim for. One inch forward or backward makes a huge difference so I always made sure I was going forward enough

* On a smooth floor, I use a piece of invisible tape to mark the spot.

* **[Example Pic: This is how I chose to remember where to place my hands and nose each time.](https://i.imgur.com/6vazB47.jpg)**

**Setup Tip #7: The distance of the hands from the feet should always be the same.**

* Setup the hands close enough to almost be an L-shape, but not tighter than an L-shape. (This was a distance of about 36"" (1 meter) for me. Your mileage may vary.)

**Setup Tip #8: Don't place the hands too close to your feet even if your flexibility allows for it.**

* The closer you bring the hands to the feet, the harder the exercise becomes. So you might think closer is better to maximize the intensity. But it's not the best course of action for consistency sake because placing your hands further back makes the exercise exponentially harder as mere millimeters change the load *significantly*.

* If your hamstring flexibility and pike compression is great and you can compress yourself tighter than an L-shape, you may be tempted to make the exercise harder by simply moving your hands backwards, but the inconsistency can cause frustration and make you think you're weak, so don't do it.

* Note: I'm not saying you should NEVER bring your hands close. Eventually, you will be able to place your feet close to your hands, do a pike pushup and lift your feet up and press up into a handstand. You can even ""teeter totter"" like that if you stay piked and are obscenely strong. But you need to choose a setting that's going to help you get the reps in.

#Tempo Tips

* **[GIF: Demo of Appropriate Tempo to Aim For](https://gfycat.com/ifr/CreativeCourageousDragonfly)**

* **Don't rush the negative phase.**
 * Slow down the negative phase so it takes a solid 2-3 seconds rather than just one second or less. In doing so you build more strength and make better use of your time.
* **Pause at the bottom occasionally**
 * This strengthens you in the hardest part of the exercise and forces you to press up using all your strength without utilizing the elastic nature of your muscular tissues because you made all the potential energy dissipate from pausing.
* **Explode up with good form**
 *  In the beginning it was hard to push quickly. It was actually impossible. But the intention is what matters. I tried to pushup as fast as possible and although it was slow, it got slowly faster. It wasn't until exactly one month into the training where I was pushing actually faster for the first time during the concentric phase. After 3 months, I could feel the quality of my strength had changed dramatically. I could muster through reps where otherwise it would've failed in the past and perform the concentric faster than ever.

So there you have it! Your comprehensive guide toward tackling the pike pushups! If you have any questions and comments, please let me know!

We bought it from a developer who bought it for a low price to do up as the previous owner lived like a squatter and the land out back was overgrown and uncared for. The developer - on first appearances - had sorted it out, planted grass and there is now a lawn with a soil patch at the bottom and the sides. He had planted some plants but we decided to get to work on planting our own.

As we've started working with the soil, it's become apparent that the work done was lazy and he had planted on top of rubble and rubbish. I've pulled party poppers, socks, bricks - everything - out from the soil however it looks like it's brilliant soil as there are hundreds and hundreds of worms. 

Just wondering from the more green fingered gardeners how they'd go about working with the land?

I'm so happy because the containers are just plastic and our winter temps were between -40 to -50°C for most of February. So much respect for such a hardy plant.

gardening,b7jdl4,"Hey all. So I've been trying to design some raised beds that are affordable. Instantly I figured I'd use 4x4 posts and 2x6 or 2x8 pressure treated (AC2) wood for this but that quickly sounds like a bad idea since those chemicals would leach into the dirt. 

However, when looking for natural wood that will hold up like cedar or redwood, then the cheap garden beds turn into a fortune. Roughly four times the cost.

What do you guys suggest as an affordable raised garden bed? I considered stapling landscape fabric over the pressure treated wood before adding soil but this is not a good barrier, moisture gets right thru these fabrics. Plus once the wood is wet from watering it likely leaches into the soil even with a bit of barrier there.

I thought about regular pine or spruce wood but we all know this will rot over time and attract termites where my house is pretty close, so it's not worth the gamble.

I'm considering biting the bullet on the expensive cedar but before I do, I want to hear about some alternatives.  I'd like it to last many years because stripping old garden beds to replace with new wood is never fun and very messy.",Pressure treated wood in raised beds,AtypicNic,1554002415.0,3,0

Do I put the seeds in my container in the soil all in the same area or do I space them out?  And how many seeds can grow in the same area?

How often do I water them if they start growing?

My question is, now that I’ve done this basic level of upkeep, what else should I prune?

gardening,b7egyq,"Hello, first time gardener here.

I have a variety of seedlings going, including several types of tomatoes and peppers mostly. The Sun Golds sprouted really quickly, I'm talking in 3-4 days they had their baby leaves already. Since then, it's been at least 3 weeks and they are only about 2 inches tall and skinny, though they all have their first ""true"" leaves. Most of my other varieties which I planted later have sprouted as well, but are also still very small and fragile. I planted everything in a mixture of coco coir, perlite, and worm castings and started everything in the 6 cell plastic trays.

After doing my own research, I've seen suggestions that maybe they needed more room to grow (though I've seen pictures on here of much larger plants still growing in the small cell trays), and so I transplanted them carefully into larger containers with the same starter soil mixture, being sure to bury some of the stem to give them a chance to grow stronger. I also fertilized with a diluted fish/kelp mixture as I've read that maybe they are lacking nutrients. They have been directly under grown lights for 16 hours per day, and on the warmer days I've been putting them in the window to soak up some sunlight.

I'm not having much luck finding specific answers on google, I just keep finding instructions. There's also the fact that I'm not going to be able to get a starter tray together and set up for at least a few days, so I figure it might be worth using paper towels to get some started sooner since I have them on hand now. I'm getting nervous about starting too late, especially with any of the longer days-to-harvest plants.

gardening,b7153f,"Every day I go outside and peek at my garden, to see each day's new growth. Spring is coming and how exciting to see the new buds forming everywhere in zone 6.

 I'm a first-time home owner and this is only my second Spring here. Last year I knew very little; I liked flowers so I planted a few lilies, and imagine my surprise when just off to the left, more lilies were popping up! A gift from the last homeowner. Wonderful to think that they will just keep multiplying with each passing year. I can see the little bulbs making their way out into the world, pushing past the soil line. Grow, little ones, grow. 

I also planted about 75 crocus bulbs last fall, before realizing the squirrels stole most of them. I found *one* not carried away, and will enjoy the hell out of that single bloom for the few days it will last. 

Luckily squirrels don't like anything from the onion family, so my alliums mostly survived. Didn't stop them from still digging one up and taking a bite -- they left the remaining bulb on the ground for me to find, how kind of them. I promptly planted it again and now its green stalk is standing proudly, a half foot fall already. I can't wait for those huge purple globe flower blooms. And I have a suspicion the squirrels re-planted many of the crocus bulbs somewhere else for me to find. What a nice surprise that shall be, to find unexpected color in secret places. 

The sun. The sun! Who knew sunlight mattered to plants in such a way, and why some of my flowers last year languished. Now I know where the sun hits most on the land and I shall use it to its full advantage. The front yard has patches of sun, and lots of very tall trees -- welcome shade, yet this means my options for flowers are limited. My hydrangea bush, I think I will have to move you, my girl -- your fabulousness requires more sunlight to flourish. 

Oh and my poor baby nectarine tree... I planted you in way too muddy of a location. Your poor feet got wet and I think you drowned. But what a lesson you taught me about where the water likes to puddle on the land, and where it drains. I will treat your sisters better in the future, and give all my fruit darlings plenty of sunny spaces so you can be extra sweet.

First it was spiders, I'm not sure why but they absolutely loved them! They were small and would web leaves together. It was ungodly frustrating cleaning them out. Lately though it's been mealybugs and I can't seem to get them to permanently go away. I had them inside during the winter and just moved the bigger one outside as it's warm again...and then within 36hrs it's covered in mealybugs again. I had been doing a diluted mixture of water and dish soap on them and thoroughly wiping the bugs off and it seems to work for a time...but I'm interested in a more permanent solution.

Mulch/compost : https://imgur.com/a/Q7qIpFF


My city offers free mulch, they say it’s yard trimmings that are sprayed with water and turned every few weeks. So no chemicals and should be heated enough to kill off weeds/seeds.

1. Is this okay to use for vegetable gardening?

2. What other things need to be mixed in? I don’t know if that’s enough nutrients. Would I just mix in some manure or fertilizer... and maybe some perlite or whatever helps retain moisture since it’s basically a giant container?

I was thinking something along the lines of a cheapo 10 dollar bottle (sonoma/paso robles if we cant find that price in napa), a 20 dollar bottle, a 50 dollar bottle, and a 100 dollar bottle. do y'all have any recommendations for these price points?

My question is: is there much of a push in the wine world to ""drink local""?  Its a big thing for craft beer right now, but since wine is more closely associated with terroir, is drinking local as big of a deal?  

I would imagine that since grapes can't be grown everywhere, higher quality would be more important than being local. With beer, you can pretty much ship your ingredients in from almost anywhere, but grapes would be more difficult.

wine,b61hz0,"My father in law is in town, and we were discussing his favorite memories of growing up on a Vineyard in rural France circa 1950s. 

He told me of a type of pitted purple grape that was the most delicious that he ever tasted. While his parents grew a couple plants of it, they never made it into wine, as it would become Vin Fou, and make the person mad/crazy. Apparently, making it was outlawed by the local government when his father was a child. 

He has very fond memories of this grape, but has no idea the species name. Most of his family is deceased, so there is no one to ask. I would like to obtain and grow these grapes in my pasture as a surprise for when we next see him. 

Can anyone guess this species? His childhood home was in Sarth, France.

Our taste is quite similar. Both of us prefer very spicy and punchy red wines. Syrah/Shiraz, Grenache and Tempranillo are among the favorites when it comes to type of grapes. 

If it helps, we generally prefer very ""earthy"" Champagne - it may be a better indicator for our taste when it comes to white wine.

I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed.

First meal is a fish based dish with Fennel (not more details, depends on the fish we can buy)

Second is Cottage Spinach Stuffed Sweet Potato (recipe: http://www.kiddieliciouskitchen.com/sweet-potato-skins/)

Third is Lamb Balls in Yogurt Curry Sauce (recipe: https://ethnicspoon.com/kofta-kari/)

I also have a bottle of ""Le Chemin d'Eolie Sur Lie Muscadet Sèvre et Maine Sur Lie 2010"" with a Repour, so ideal if that would match one of the dishes.
Beyond that, I'd like to try a canadian ice wine (of which I have several) but I'm guessing as a sweet wine that would be hard.
I'd like a heavier red out of personal taste but I'm afraid it wouldn't match that well with whats on the menu.

I can honestly say they are some of the most exciting new wines I've tasted in years. In the process of begging for an allocation, I was able to talk to the man himself and discuss some interesting topics including skin contact whites, natural wine and more. 

I think guys will enjoy the discussion. Sorry it's not the best audio. This is my first one.

#AUDIO STARTS:

**MASON: I wanted to thank you for the allocation of Syrah. I know all your wines are in pretty high demand. How much wine do you make? What is your production size?**

SCOTT: Yeah, we’re probably just over the 2000 to 2500 [cases] mark as of this year. So, we’re getting there, we chip away at it every year. We started in 2010 with two tons and every year we just add a little bit more.

**MASON: Do you have a size you want to max out at?**

SCOTT: You know that’s always kind of a funny number depending on who you ask. A lot of people kind of quote that 4000 range as being pretty sustainable. A lot of what we do, those resources are relatively finite, so If it can get into the 3000 to 4000 range that would be pretty amazing. Even getting there might be a struggle but that seems pretty ideal.

# ***“I was always shocked by people’s myopia. They’d drink Chard, Pinot, Cab… It was really limited. It just kind of drove me nuts.”***

[Image of Melon Label](https://i.imgur.com/qtleHpy.png) 



**MASON: Nice. So I wanted to ask you about some of the grapes you work with. Trousseau Gris, Melon de Bourgogne, Valdiguié… these are not the most recognizable grapes. Why do you work with these unique varietals?**


SCOTT: It’s kind of a funny thing so I’m going to give you a miniature backstory. Coming from Chicago I’ve literally other than this only just about ever worked in restaurants and in just about every single capacity too, from dishwasher, busboy, bartender and some back of the house stuff, a lot of different positions in the kitchen… The eventuality was in end of 2006 beginning of 2007 the Keller group and the girl that I’d been dating at the time moved us to California. She was working at French Laundry and I was working at Bouchon. It was such a transition coming from a lot of fine dining in Chicago where the wine lists are so worldly and often very Eurocentric — to then, coming to Napa where even the wine bar of Bouchon was 50/50. It was half French and half domestic which even that is very constricting. But I was always shocked by people’s myopia. They’d drink Chard, Pinot, Cab, maybe Bordeaux blend, maybe Sauvignon Blanc — it was really limited. It just kind of drove me nuts.

## ***So, a lot of things were borne out of that, like the the name, Jolie Laide. It’s idiomatic but it’s unconventionally attractive. It literally is “beautiful-ugly”, that is different but good”***


So, a lot of things were borne out of that, [like the] the name, Jolie Laide. It’s idiomatic but it’s unconventionally attractive. It literally is “beautiful-ugly”, that is different but good. It’s usually reserved for a woman who looks a bit different but is kind of better for it. It was a term that had just been floating around in my head anyway that I’d read many years ago and it just became so pertinent when we were starting this because for those same reasons. I couldn’t believe that people didn’t like Gamay or Ribolla or Vermentino or whatever it is. You wouldn’t eat the same thing every day or listen to the same music every day. But people choose to drink the same wine every day? It just doesn’t make any sense to me.

# ***“You wouldn’t eat the same thing every day or listen to the same music every day. But people choose to drink the same wine every day? It just doesn’t make any sense to me. “***

So, when there’s so many people here, be it Raj and Sashi and Ehren Jordan and all the guys who do Chardonnay and Pinot Noir so well.. Why would you want to compete with that? They already do it. There’s not really something missing there. And there wasn’t — well there is, but not as much — focus on a lot of the others grapes and, like I said, just because, yes Gamay had been ostracised from Burgundy a long time ago but just because you drink Pinot Noir doesn’t mean you can’t drink Gamay or try a Frappato. Just because you drink Cabernet doesn’t mean you can’t try a Cab Franc. They’re still great and they’re beautiful and they’re delicious, they’re just not what you’re used to or familiar with or what your friends drink.

**MASON: Is there some sort of price advantage to working with obscure varietals? I mean, growers struggle to sell Valdiguie (or maybe they don’t nowadays)- but is it easier to get in and start making wine with those grapes as opposed to Cab or Pinot?**


SCOTT: That’s definitely a yes and no question. Sure, the ability to command a high price for some of these obscurities has shifted quite a bit. The first year I bought Trousseau Gris I think we paid $900 a ton or something like that. It literally used to be blended into Hartford Court Chardonnay. As you know, you’re allowed a certain percentage of other varieties or whatever you want to blend in and that whole vineyard was being blended away because nobody really wanted it. It was Pax, who I worked for for many years, he was the first one to start working with the Trousseau Gris. In the year I came over to work with him he said ‘You know you can make a ton or two if you want.’ It wasn’t that I’d worked a couple of harvests and I felt like I know it all I’m going to start a wine brand, it was more Pax is going to let me make a ton or two just as a tangible learning experience. Let’s see what happens if I don’t have someone telling me what to do, just use intuition. So that’s where I began, he said ‘Well what would you want to make?’ and I said ‘Well I’d love some of the Trousseau Gris, it’s so fascinating to me being a lover of Trousseau. But I get it, there’s probably none out there or you have it all.’ And he was like ‘No! There’s ten acres — 40 tons — of it out there. Nobody wants!.’

**MASON: That’s amazing.**

SCOTT: It’s so funny, and that paradigm has shifted greatly, be it myself and Tegan (Turley) and especially the people before me like Petroski (Larkmead/Massican Winery) and Matthiasson. The fact that we now pay about $2500 a ton and they’ve literally threatened to take it away from us because their waiting list is so long now. That one in particular is one of the few, if only, remaining vineyards of Trousseau. So that one’s a little bit different. But sure, there’s old vine Valdiguie and even more so Zin and Carignan. So those are the ones that are a little bit easier, even those prices have gone up. So, yes is half the answer but the other half is no. Using things like Gamay and Melon it’s such an obscurity that it’s a huge pain in the ass. You have to travel, you have to go to regions that are, y’know, just like any kind of real estate where we’re at, if you can sell Pinot Noir for $5000 to $7000 a ton how am I ever going to convince you to put Gamay in and give to me for $2500 to $3000? So that challenges are not totally insurmountable but they’re definitely elevated for sure. So, this is why you see people like Hardy Wallace. Follow him around he’s all over the place. We go to up to Calaveras, up to several different spots in the foothills. We go up to Mendocino, we go down as far as Chalone. You’re really driving to the places where things are more affordable and/or you have a line on the growers who are willing to be a little bit different.

**MASON: Speaking of those growers, when you buy these grapes are you purchasing them by weight or are you leasing by the acre? How does that break down?**

SCOTT: Thus far everything for me has been in tonnage, not by acre. We have our dedicated areas and rows, and there’s definitely years like this year — you’ve probably heard from a lot of people — a lot of the fruit hanging was heavier than normal which is usually great news, they say ‘Oh we thought we were going to get you three tons and it turns out it’s five!’, phenomenal that’s amazing, I’ll take it. The two Syrah vineyards we work with Halkon and Hawks Butte, those were planted by Wells Guthrie for Copain originally. I’ve known the owner of the property for quite a while. He also makes wine from the same vineyard of course. When I was a buyer he was selling me wines and I was always a fan — he tends to pick a little bit riper than even we do or than Copain did — but I was always a fan of the Copain versions of those Syrahs. I joking said ‘Hey Paul, should Syrah ever become available’, this is seven years ago — jeez it’s closer to ten years ago this was back when I was still in restaurants — eventually Copain walked away from Halkon because they were on acreage contracts and their yields were so bad that when you do the math you end up paying something like $10,000 a ton versus y’know… They backed out and he switched the format so we pay all just per ton.

# ***We’ve done everything to make it challenging for the consumer. Be it a name that people don’t understand or varieties they’ve never heard of like Trousseau Gris. Then they pour it and they’re like : What the…? This is such a weird color, why is it like this?’***

[Image of 2017 release.](https://imgur.com/zqPrI3B)

**MASON: I wanted to ask about the white wines you make, because Trousseau Gris, Pinot Gris with a little bit of skin contact, I don’t know if everyone understands what that is or what that does to the wine. So I’m just wondering what you like about a little bit of skin contact as far as the wine’s aromatics and texture?**


SCOTT: That is the challenge when people ask me about the brand. I’ve done relatively everything to make it challenging for the consumer. Be it a name that people don’t know what it means or how to say it, or varieties they’ve never heard of like Trousseau Gris. Then they pour it and they’re like ‘What the…? This is such a weird color, why is it like this?’ It’s kind of all of the things. The people who are savvy totally get it and are more interested, just for the general masses it’s definitely confusing. There’s plenty of wine that have a little bit of skin contact — even things you don’t associate it with like Gruner. Then there’s tons of ethereal, completely skin fermented orange wines. How it works with a lot of those in restaurant, we tend to sit around and say ‘Oh man that’s so interesting. What should we pair this with, where are we going to put it on our tasting menu?’, because we want to expose people to it but it’s such an application wine because of the texture and the tannin. It’s not something you want to drink a bottle of or several glasses of. You want to have a taste of it with a certain dish and move along. So, I like the concept of skin contact, I just want to barely tiptoe into it so that there’s a little more breadth and palette and some visceral texture, but not be so much that you all of a sudden have to break out cheese. If you want to drink it quickly that’s cool, great. But at the same time if you want to be a little more cerebral then there is that sort of mouthfeel and texture to think about.


# ***They ask, “Is this a rosé or orange wine?” and I say it’s technically neither. It’s a white wine with color, but that’s not really a category so you decide where to put it.***

[Glass of WindGap Trousseau Gris
](https://imgur.com/Nk8mXqN)

**MASON: Yeah, you’re not making orange wine…**


SCOTT: No, definitely not. That’s the other confusion, even when people are writing it on wine lists they say ‘Well where should I put this? Is it a Rose or an orange wine?’ and I say it’s technically neither. It’s a white wine with color, but that’s not really a category so you decide where to put it.

**MASON: A little side note, I had a bottle of Wind Gap Trousseau Gris returned by a customer just based on the color. They didn’t even taste the wine which is shame because it’s delicious. I think we ended up drinking the wine ourselves, but maybe these need some sort of explanation…**

SCOTT: The first year we made [Wind Gap Trousseau Gris] I went into it with this idea of some skin contact and didn’t know how much color it’d take up at first. Back then we still used to share the same space with Duncan and Nathan from Arnot-Roberts. I was in there stepping on the grapes in bins, and Duncan looked at me and was like ‘What are you doing? Is this a whole cluster cold soaking Trousseau Gris?’ and I just put my arms up in the air and was like ‘Yeah, I mean… I think so? Seems like a good idea!’

Funnily enough I was just at a wedding this weekend and the kid who got married actually pulled out that very wine, the 2010 Trousseau Gris, which was funny to taste so many years later. It was actually still very fresh. I’ve had the ’11 and that’s not the case, but the ’10 was still really intact. After making that wine we put it in bottle, let it sit for a while until finally it was the time to start actually putting it in the market, we pulled the corks and tasted it. It was a very bright, kind of awkward, peachy hue to it, not something most people are familiar with. You hinted at it in your question but it does totally change the texture and it really lifts the aromatics as well, like completely different.


There’s continuity when you taste the Pax version and my version, you recognize the characteristics of the variety but then they become so much different with the skin contact. The first vintage, we tasted the wine before we decided if we were actually going to sell this wine. ‘Is it good? Do we think it’s good?’ and then we’d try and be like ‘Shit, I think that’s really good!’ But we didn’t know. We just thought it was good — but we’d made it — but was it the ugly baby effect or was it really good? So, we’d give it away and taste it with some friends and ‘No, no, no that’s legitimately delicious!’ The confidence was born out of other people trying it. I think the first year was two days on the skins, we’ve done 4 and 5 and gone as many as 7 and then backed up again because we didn’t like that as much, so it’s kind of different every year. We’ve more or less settled on the 3–4 range and that’s just depending on the pragmatics of the winery, logistical stuff. At that point it’s just aqueous, just sugar water, there’s no heat or alcohol yet so we’re not really extracting much. So, if it’s on the skins day 3 and we’re not pressing anything until the next day then we’ll just wait the extra day.

**MASON: I also wanted to ask about the Gamay, because I’m pretty picky with Gamay especially from places that are not Beaujolais. I wanted to ask you about the vineyard you work with. For me, I really like Gamay that’s made naturally and in very particular soils. I was just wondering about your thoughts on the variety in California?**

SCOTT: Fortunately Steve Edmunds worked with Ron Mansfield a long time ago, very specifically because of the soils up there, so he convinced Ron to go to Beaujolais with him and then they came back and went up to the foothills where Barsotti is, so it more synonymous with the northern part of Beaujolais. You call it red but it’s more like pink granite so there’s higher iron levels which is pretty ideal. I think Steve is the one that recognised it so long ago. But going up again with Duncan and Nathan and Raj and looking around, Gamay being a variety I’ve just always loved and being in California and looking around it was Valdiguie which showed up more. People would be like ‘Oh I’ve got Gamay!’ and you’d go visit the vineyard like Frediani in Calisota — who actually just passed away — and be like ‘Is this Gamay or is this Valdiguie?’ and they’d be ‘No that’s the same thing!’ and I’d say ‘Well, no it’s not the same. It’s actually quite different.’ So, Steve Edmunds, I actually called him years ago and asked him if he would meet me. He lives in Berkeley so I drove down to Berkeley and met César which is a couple of doors up from Chez Panisse. Told him how much I loved his Gamay and I would love the opportunity if it ever aros to work with a little bit of it. At the time, he was the only one that was getting it and he pretty much just politely said ‘No way.’ We hung out a little bit longer, I was bummed but I was excited to meet him so I walked him home and got in the car and was like ‘OK, maybe I won’t get Gamay.’ We started looking in Oregon for maybe people who would plant it and then Ron started putting more in so Duncan, Nathan and Raj started taking quite a bit and I actually had to wait for about four years on the waiting list so that production was viable enough for me to take a little bit as well. It’s very interesting, maybe you’ve seen it or I’m sure you’ve read about it or one of the other guys has told you about it, but Ron does this funny thing where — not typical in California as far as I know — where it’s a vertical headtrain, not a headtrain like you’d see in Chateauneuf or something where it’s low, but also it’s not on cordon, it’s head trained but it goes up so it spirals around so it’s about as tall as I am, 5'8"" or something. So I was like ‘Ron, explain this to me, why do you farm it like this?’, and the Mansfields they have Goldbud farms they grow all kinds of fruit — wine grapes of course but all kinds of fruit, nectarines and peaches and plums — and he just looked at me and said ‘Well, I’m a fruit farmer, I understand trees. To me this makes sense. All of the things you’re trying to get out of VSP (Vertical Shoot Positioning), it’s facing the fruit out, it’s dappling sunlight.’ and I was like ‘OK, wow this is fascinating this is not something that I’ve ever seen before.’ So he does quite a bit of that up there.

[Image of Barsotti Vineyard](https://imgur.com/vxADsQz)

**MASON: I don’t think I’ve seen that yet. I need to look that up.**

SCOTT: Also going into one of your other questions. Both Duncan and Nathan take from both vineyards — Barsotti and Witters- I only get the Barsotti portion. Both are great, but I’m very content with that. I’m contiguous with Duncan and Nathan, I’m actually just beneath them underneath the hill, so I’m in a little bit of a cooler spot because airflow goes down. They inspired it but we also we pay more per tonne than anyone else in the vineyard for Ron not to spray Roundup. So, we pay $500 extra per tonne because you’ve got to go in and hand-hoe.


**MASON: I think that’s pretty important. Getting into the next question, I don’t like to throw the word ‘natural’ around, especially with winemakers because there’s a lot of baggage and it doesn’t really mean exactly the same thing to different people. But, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the techniques you use in the vineyard or maybe in the cellar? From what I understand you’re using wild yeast, do a lot of foot-treading and lower sulphur, I mean these are not industrialized wine production techniques… this is smaller, maybe more natural style wine making. Would you agree with that or how would you characterize it?**

SCOTT: I would completely agree with everything you’ve just said. The term is so grey area and it’s becoming so cultish and confusing, so I also try and stay away from it. The first harvest I worked — or the first several harvests — was with a group called Realm. I was at the restaurant in Yountville, Bouchon and everyone who came in — tourism aside of course — was in the wine business on some level. Be it Christian Moueix or the Shafers, some who were really great, some people who were not really great. But then winemakers, viticulturalists, cellar masters. So, then there was a few winemakers I was getting to know and wanted to follow along, but it’s tough to follow some of these guys like the Andy Erikson’s and the Thomas Brown’s, they have like 20 clients and they’re all over the place. So, I met Juan Mercado who owns Realm and he said ‘Yeah, come on up to the winery.’ It was the equivalent of what I’d used to do in restaurants where you just kind of sign up and work for free and spend a couple of days or a couple of weeks. I did that for the ’07 harvest, I was still working at the restaurant but any free time I could spare I’d just go to the winery. That next year, the post-harvests they said, ‘We’re in a grape-phase do you want to be our cellar master?’, so I became their first employee. I was like ‘Jeez, you guys are offering me a job but I don’t really have any experience.’ ‘Well don’t worry about it, we have a winemaker. As long as you can listen and follow directions and execute your work orders then that’s all we need.’ They felt comfortable enough with me so I worked with them for a few years as their cellar master.

# *""In Napa it was ‘pick it really ripe, add a bunch of water and acid’. Everything was inoculated, 100% new oak… I was like ‘OK, this is as much of this world as I can handle, I need to be more inspired and work for people who make wines that I like to drink.’""*

It was definitely an introduction to what most people would call qualitative wine making — taking a lot of care, being very protective but at the same time it was very bombastic Napa Cabernet. The people who love those wines definitely love those wines and they get hundred points scores. But it was, Pick it really ripe, saignée bunches it, add a bunch of water which means you have to add a bunch of acid. Everything was inoculated, 100% new oak. I did that for ’08 and ’09 and then 2010 came around and I was like ‘OK, this is as much of this world as I can handle, I need to be more inspired and work for people who make wines that I like to drink and that’s when I started to work more at Duncan and Nathan (Arnot Roberts) and Brocway (Broc Cellars) and Steve Edmunds and all of these people that just weren’t quite big enough to hire anyone. I did a harvest with Pax in ’10, ’11 I was back in Napa, ’12 on I was working with Pax.


Once I got to Pax it was the shared space at Pax, Brian Glad and Duncan Nathan that disproved everything I was taught on the Napa side. Nothing had to be inoculated, they would brown their whites, no stems were taken away, they didn’t really worry about a couple of leaves whereas in Napa of course we had all this big fancy equipment and fourteen women on the sorting table taking every single piece of anything out of the ferment that wasn’t a perfect ripe berry. Coming to Pax we’d jump in the bins, step on it, rotate it, throw some dry ice on it and wait for it to start to ferment. It was a very fast lesson. I mean there’s no right or wrong, it’s just whatever way you decide to go. Having worked with Pax for so many years, and you see it with all the same names — Duncan and Ryan and now Jamie — the continuity or the ideology is similar across the board. We all do things a little bit differently, but I think that’s just like cooking. We could all try to make the same recipe from the same raw ingredients and the thumb print kind of comes out a little bit differently. But it was a fascinating lesson to switch sides if you will.

So yeah, in the cellar nothing is inoculated even if something gets stuck. We don’t have temperature control, we stick things in the sun if we need to get them warm. We’re really not looking for big extractive temperatures anyway so we don’t need to get things really hot. It’s really lo-fi. All the reds thus far have been whole-cluster, we just step on them, we try to mitigate tannins in different ways because we like the flavour of the stems, we just don’t want to beat up the stems too much so we’re just very gentle with them in the ferments.


**MASON: And then use sulphur at the end?**

SCOTT: That kind of depends on the wine and it depends on acid and pH of certain wines and/or the VA where it stands post-primary. We don’t sulphur anything coming into the building unless it was needed like a year like 2011 where there’s a lot of mold or rot or something. Then maybe you’d have more to worry about, but most of our stuff comes in really clean. We generally hopefully get out to the vineyard and drop anything that shouldn’t be coming in. We’re not really worried about a couple of leaves here and there, it’s not a big deal. We just foot-stomp everything, let it run. It’s usually pumped down for the first half generally, then we switch the pumps over just to be more gentle on the stems. Depending on the vintage, our rooms are pretty cold so often malolactic doesn’t complete until the spring which we’re totally comfortable with. Usually things aren’t getting sold until the spring, after malo. They usually get hit once, then double checked once they go back up for bottling in the fall — or call it end of summer, usually we’re bottling at the end of July in preparation for the next harvest. Which is also twofold, 1) we want to get a lot of preserved freshness so we like to bottle young, but the other half of that is we also need those barrels back — we’re definitely restricted on space. Less time in barrel means less time to get stale, less total sulphur going into the wine because we’re not monitoring sulphur and continually adding sulphur.

**MASON: Besides the sulphur, are there any other techniques you’re using to mitigate VA, are you topping a lot?**

SCOTT: For sure. Jaimee and I like to top more than Pax, and that’s not one’s better than the other, I think we just have less experience so maybe we’re a little more protective. But she and I definitely tend to be in the two to three week turn, a lot of people are in the kind of month or so turn. We do a fair amount of carbonic, Pax does it a bunch on just about everything these days. For gamay we start it, we force in the carbonics for the first part and then we open it and step on it and let it sit whole cluster so it does have some time on the skins and stems so there’s some extraction. Maybe one of the techniques that’s possible different to some people is we often do use the piet d’coup where we’ll put — for the Gamay example — we’ll put it into whatever vessel it fits into whole. We’ll rotate it with a forklift or a shovel if we have to and then we’ll take something else that’s fermenting, and it’s usually something that’s in that phase where it’s about from lag to log where it’s 22 to 20 in a 19 range, that’s where we start ripping. We put a gallon or two of that into the bottom of the fermenter so that there’s something already fermenting and creating CO2 so that as that sugar gets released there’s something there to eat it. Otherwise, we had found in years past that we kind of had this long waiting game. At the beginning of this harvest we had ferments that didn’t start for almost 9 or 10 days. So, putting grapes into a vessel and then sealing it with nothing happening? That can lead to VA (Volitile Acidity), so we wanted that kickstarter so we dip something into the vessel with the grapes, throw some dry ice and CO2 in there, seal it then stick it out in the sun. As it’s releasing a little bit of sugar it’s mixing with whatever was fermenting at the bottom and it really traps a bunch of CO2 in there and it forces everything to ferment. So, depending on the weather — there’s no way to open it — you kind of have to roll the bones. Depending on the weather outside, if it’s not that hot or it is hot we kind of open it in the five to seven day range, and usually things are fermented about halfway or three quarters already in the berry. They’re kind of like boozy candies at this point, there’s a little bit of sugar but they’re mostly alcohol. The colour looks a little bit funny from that because we haven’t crushed a lot of the skins so a lot of the fruit looks almost a little it greyed. But then you step on it and it just releases the rest of the sugar and it just takes off. It has so much heat and momentum and the sugar hasn’t really been released yet so when you do it just it rips to dryness in a couple of days.

**MASON: That’s cool. I met Pax a couple of days ago and I asked him a lot of these same questions. I’ve been drinking his wine and the Wind Gap ones for a long time and I love them. Then this year I tried your Syrah and was pretty blown away; and the Mondeuse from Jaimee I also thought was amazing. Is there anything unusual you’ve picked up from working with Pax or is there anything you do different with Syrah than some of the other producers that you’ve mentioned that you’ve learned from?**

SCOTT: I think one of the things I’ve definitely learned from Pax that this carbonic game we’ve been playing with, he’s obviously had way more wine to make over the years than I have, so a lot of that experimentation was happening on his wines. Eventually we came to a point where we really liked the results and it’s really a trip to see when you open a tank that’s been lots of carbonic you wouldn’t think there’d be any colour, but then the juice in the bottom of the tank is so vibrant. I think technically, scientifically you shift your pH and lose a little bit of that acid forcing things into carbonics but thee colour is so vibrant. But then also working with Syrah from colder sites, it leaves us in a position when we’re picking early at the colder sites so when we say ‘Pick early’ we mean pick early by brix level, not necessarily by date. Being in a colder site we get more hang time, we just don’t balloon full of sugar. Generally that means we have a healthier pH, a lower pH to leave all the stems in because obviously with all the potassium it shifts your pH up quite a bit. With all the whole cluster if we’re still finishing up at a 3–7 pH and has all that bright, violent aromatic with all the pepper and the things we adore about Syrah — not everyone loves that but we’re headstrong and completely adore it so we keep doing it that way.

#***“I think most people would probably say I’m crazy but if the wine itself and the vineyard itself has that much character on its own, adding all that oak just totally diminishes it.”***


**MASON: That’s what I think is amazing about your Syrah. It’s what, 12.3% or 12.8% alcohol?**

SCOTT: Yeah, it depends on the year.

**MASON: And then there’s an intensity to them but there’s also a sort of real sense of the varietal character and the terroir character that you don’t get in a lot of new world wines. Or at least I don’t, from tasting a lot of Syrah from California sometimes they’re pretty oaked and pretty big. Some of them are really good but you don’t get that… I want to say ‘old world’ but it’s just a sense of place that you don’t normally see. It’s amazing to taste your wines because I feel like you get that when you try them. Sorry that’s not really a question, more a comment!**

SCOTT: Well no that’s amazing, it’s always great to hear. 2 or 3 days ago we opened a 2017 Bedrock from Bien Nacido. Obviously we’re good buddies with those guys and I traded some wines with Cody and he was like ‘Man you have to try this Syrah, this might be one of the most ringer Syrah’s we’ve made in a while!’, so we finally opened one the other day and the wine behind it is delicious, I didn’t even look to see what the alcohol was… Oh, it’s actually 12.5, there you go! But, they’re just in a more populous style where they like a little more oak and they’re a little more gratuitous in that. But like I said the wine behind that is so delicious and has so much character that it’s definitely marred by oak. I think most people would probably say I’m crazy but the wine itself and the vineyard itself has that much character on its own, adding all that oak just totally diminishes it. Halcon Vineyard &amp; Hawks Butte, Halcon in particular is high elevation, it’s super rocky, this really cultured soil.. We don’t have to spray much sulphur in the vineyard at all because we’re above the fog line and it’s really windy. There’s all these great things about it that brining that it in and throwing a bunch of oak on it just doesn’t make much sense. The longer that I’ve been working with Pax on this side, we’ll have all the Syrah’s down and be putting stuff up to tank in like Golden Glens or Sonoma Coast or what have you, and the three of us will be dipping into barrels and I’ll be like ‘Shit, this one’s pretty oaky. Where’s that from?’, and we’ll check the barrel to see what it is and it’s like a 2008 — it was a new barrel in 2008 and we’ve used it ever since. Being so isolated from new oak all the time it really shows up a lot, I guess we’re sensitive to it.

**MASON: Speaking of amazing vineyards for Syrah, are there any other vineyards you’re looking at in the future or maybe styles of wine? Sparkling wine? Do you make a Rose?**

SCOTT: Being so small — it was started just as me and it was all out of pocket. My girlfriend we live together, she’s a winemaker on another property. It would be totally unfair for me to say it’s just me because it’s totally not, especially on the back end of things. As we’ve grown, she’s watched me get busier and busier over the years and she’d say things like ‘Let’s go to the beach.’ or ‘Let’s go here.’ and I’d be like ‘Honey, I can’t. I have to be on the computer.’ So, she was like ‘You need help!’ and she just absorbed right into it. And it wouldn’t be here without her, for sure.

That being said, all of our — because we’re so small — when people call me — and it happens every year whether it’s Pax or myself — ‘Hey there’s some extra Cab Franc’ or ‘Hey there’s some Rielsing in Henderson Valley.’ Being some small and out of pocket, you can’t really just wildly jump into thins. You have to be very conscious and concise in what you’re going to take on. They year we started making Rose was ’15 where in ’15 everybody was coming up extremely short across the board and we were already taking a bunch from what we colloquially call ‘Buddah’s’ in Mendo where Hardy and Pax and Michael Cruse and everyone pulls a bit of stuff from there. And that year I was so short on fruit there was some Syrah decline, some really old vines with Syrah and it’s literally like every 4th vine is still alive. So what happens to that? ‘Well you can have it if you want, it’ll probably be a tonne, tonne and a half, it’s just so old and in bad shape and virused means it doesn’t get very ripe.’ We picked that and masked it with some Carignan and made some Rose out of it just to no be down a SKU. So that was the first year we made a Rose, kind of as a Hail Mary. And there’s all this old vine Valdiguié out there, so the last three years we were like ‘Let’s try Valdiguié for Rose.’ So, we do make one, but it wasn’t really something we went in saying ‘We need to make a Rose!’, it’s just the fruit was there, it was available and the fruit was good so we do it. But there’s so many other things — like the Gamay or the Melon or the Syrah — not to say they have more purpose or poignancy or anything… I’m not sure what my point is, we do make one it’s just another SKU in the system.

Sparkling is most certainly something I want to play with, but it’s something I want to really understand and do correctly, so I haven’t done it yet. We’ve made a few Pét-Nats from around the cellar over the years, we never quite nail the grams per litre correctly. They’re either too gassy or not gassy enough, sometimes pretty turgid and sometimes pretty reductive. It’s even things I’ve talked to Cruse about. Cruse makes sparkling wine for all kinds of people of course and he was like ‘I’ll do it for you but it’s going to cost you a bunch of money.’ and I was like ‘No… that’s just not really the way I want to do it.’ Sparkling is something I’d definitely like to do if I could afford it. When it comes to drinking, if I could just drink champagne all the time I would, I love the searing acid, I love all the soil and the mineral, that to me is like all the time. I love Syrah and all those other things too but at a dinner party you almost have to remind me that red wine exists because I like light, crispy — anything that shows true soil or whether it’s reduction and people call it true soil, that’s a confusing topic as well.

We’re working with a couple of people. It’s tough to do when you’re smaller, but now that things are becoming more financially viable there’s varieties that you’re seeing more and more. Pax and Jamie and Raj are bringing more and more stuff over. Pax I’m sure told you about the vineyard he just planted which has all kinds of cool things like Gamay, Poulsard, Trousseau and some Savagnin and Mondeuse. So more and more of that is happening. Sashi has kind of a library block of things they keep bringing back from Europe. There’s other varieties that I like a lot. We’re working on getting some Aligote cuttings from Oregon and getting some into California. The only stuff we really found here in California was really virused and you can’t really move it around — which is admittedly also true of the Melon that we take. The shelf life of that is probably not very long unfortunately. It’s amazing soils for the variety but it’s too vigorous. So 1) we can’t move it around and 2) it’s not very prolific. The family that bought that vineyard two years ago, they love having it there and they want to keep it there as long as they can, but at the same time financially it doesn’t make a lot of sense.

**MASON: Well awesome man. I have a million more questions, but I have to write this stuff down so I don’t want to keep asking and have a bunch of stuff to transcribe. Thanks again for the time, this was awesome.**

SCOTT: My pleasure. I’m not sure if I said this in the email but Paul’s been on me to get out there (in a good way not in a bad one). My excuse before was having two jobs that didn’t really afford me a lot of travel time because when you see Pax in Colorado and New York and LA that’s usually because I’m in the cellar and he’s not. Now that I technically don’t work for Pax anymore that also severed one income so I’m not doing a whole bunch of travelling, more just tipping away at and growing this. That being said, I think Paul’s working on getting me out there in the spring sometime.

**MASON: The more wine you allocate the more we can sell. Paul does an amazing job and I’m excited to get this on the list. If you ever do come out we should definitely hang out. You should come and check out the store.**

SCOTT: I think we’re working on it for the spring. The only trips of course are New York and LA are very important markets and that’s where I sell the most wine. I’m from Chicago so we’re working on maybe doing a bounce in Colorado on the way to Chicago sort of trip.

**MASON: Well cool, thanks again. I’ll send you this when I send it out through the mailer.**

SCOTT: Thanks man, I appreciate the support, it means a lot.

I was most impressed by the extremely luxurious, almost foamy, mouthfeel (as opposed to stronger, harsher bubbles), and by what I thought was a very refined (i.e., not too agressive and more complex and thoughtful) flavor profile of cream (LOVE the cream and had never experienced it in sparkling wine before), gentle lemon curd, and yeast/bread notes.

I'd love to find more Champagne and sparkling wines that showcase similar qualities, but I'm not sure why the above wine turned out the way it did.

It states on the website a standard bordeau bottle should fit neck to neck, but none of my 60 bottles fit. I contacted them, and their answer was to alternate bordeau bottles with smaller bottles to make them fit and that they are not responsible? There is no such thing as a standard bordeaux bottle they state. Regardless their website states :""The wine cellar will hold up to 150 ‘standard’ Bordeaux sized bottles, as shown below.""

I dont know. For 1499 i feel like i was ripped off. In the pictures where the bottles do seem to fit, they only fit because the back of the bottle is elevated on top of the edge of the shelve so they are leaning downwards.

Buyer beware? Does anyone have any tips or maybe has run into this?

UPDATE:

I talked to the reps at wine enthusiast and they are no help. They told me the stacking only works with standard bordeaux bottles and this is the image they shared. I told them that is the exact dimensions that i am using to which they followed up that stating 'up to 150 standard bordeaux with that size' doesnt mean it will actually fit them. It fits UP to 150, regardless of whether you use the recommended bordeaux bottles. I told them this is false advertising and i was told everyone in the industry does this. 

Their solution was the following picture (see link)

[https://imgur.com/a/Kf05cnk](https://imgur.com/a/Kf05cnk)

That would not allow for stacking and even in their solution which has less bottles per rack than advertised, the bottles are rubbing up against each other.

The real issue here is that the shelves are just not deep enough and you would have to rest a bottle on the back ledge to get it to fit. I told them as an alternative they could send me a new set of shelves and i would cut off the back ledge and put some felt on there so bottles wouldnt slip. I would need reassurance that wouldnt mess with airflow. They told me that they could not do that unless i pay for the shelves. They also will not take it back unless i pay for 260 dollar shipping and a $300 dollar restocking fee. They would waive those if i buy another more expensive unit.

Why I'm here: I want to formalize my certification/knowledge in the wine industry and pursue work specifically as a somm. I've worked with many with both WSET and CMS levels of certification, but only have a professional amateurs knowledge (way better than most but less than others) of wines.

My question: Specifically from a US standpoint, is the WSET or the CMS preferred in candidates applying for sommelier jobs? Will one make me stand out over another? If I should take a mix of each program, which courses would you recommend I get from each?

Over the Christmas holidays I went to the top steak restaurant in my city with the s.o. and brought a bottle of 2010 Corton Clos du Roi. My cellar isn't too deep and I consider it a more of a special bottle that I've been sitting on for a while. The corkage at this restaurant is $50, so it's really only worth it if you bring something nice. They do have a very extensive wine list with top not stuff DRC, Lala's, Opus, Sassicaia etc etc. So you know that the staff should know their wine.

The night starts off with our server (not the somm) taking out generic red glasses and placing them before us on the table. In the middle of him unfoiling and making chit chat, another server swoops in a whispers something in his ear. He puts the bottle down, takes the glasses away, and comes back with red burgundy glasses. Nothing terrible, but maybe an indication of things to come. Mind you, I've been to this restaurant many times, have brought my own bottle a few times, and every service has been excellent.

Mid way through the meal the wine is showing well and the steaks are great. There's a service table behind me, in the middle of the room, where all the table's wines are. My glass has maybe 1.5oz left in it so naturally the waiter discreetly swooped in to refill. Except. It wasn't my Corton. I see a bottle of DUCKHORN filling my wine. I had to do a double take and he went away before I could process what had just happened. I asked my s.o. if she noticed to and she agreed it wasn't our wine. I tasted the glass and it was...not my wine to say the least. At this point I'm fuming. I get the server over and he acknowledges his mistake. The GM comes by...profusely apologizes. She did offer us free dessert and a glass of D'Yquem at the end of the meal. I think it was a new server....

Backstory: I’m mid-30s, single mom with 2 wonderful but able-challenged kids, and I’m finally graduating with my bachelors in June from a college I never thought I’d ever get in to.

So, I want to have a party and invite everyone who has been a part of my/our path to this point. I owe everyone a huge debt of thanks, and I’d like to do it with wine. Lots of wine. 

The problem is, I’m awful at picking wine and my pallet is probably really laughable. I can’t afford really expensive bottles, but I do have a 2017 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay to give everyone a sip. I hope it’s a good one. I know what I do like and what I don’t, so can anyone help?

Like: French whites usually. Slightly sweet and fruity, light, bubbly, rosé, Pinot Grigio. I’ve had some awesome reds too, but a lot are so heavy and spicy or bitter (?) that I feel white is safe. I don’t want to stay safe though. 

Dislike: super bitter, spicy...Cabernet Sauvignon...I don’t know more than that, so I guess that’s it. 

In short, what wines should I start with? I’ll take a list to the store and start tasting, but I’d like more options than plain old Merlot or Sauvignon Blanc. Special request: I’d like to get a nice (read: a bit more expensive) wine for my mom. ",Graduation wine help?,HelloEchoEcho,1552721232.0,2,0

I tried the PTC paper test myself, and found I am a ""nontaster."" Now that I'm out of college and looking into the culinary and wine industries, I'm curious: what value does the majority of the community put on innate genetic tasting ability vs. trained skills of recognition?

wine,azlv41,"When I passed my WSET 3 last year, my amazing wife surprised me by booking us a trip to Napa to celebrate.  Most of my wine experience has been heavily biased to Old World wines.  Since this is our first trip to Napa and I'm not terribly educated about the region, I planned out our trip using the plethora of threads here on r/wine.  This community was such a valuable input to my planning, so it only makes sense that I post up my plans here to get any last minute feedback in the event that I need to make adjustments.  

&amp;#x200B;

A few notes:

\- Philosophy: We're comfortable with a leisurely pace and don't feel we need to cram tastings in.  We're both workaholics that rarely take vacation, so it's more important that we enjoy our experiences (and be able to relax a bit) vs. volume drinking.  I've tried to find a balance between satisfying my wine-nerdery and just experiencing this fascinating place and the people who inhabit it.  

\- Taste Preferences: I'll drink anything, wife's preferences are more Sauvignon Blanc (loves Sancerre) and Pinot.

\- Hotel: The wife booked us at Hotel Villagio in Yountville, so that will be our 'hub' this trip.

\- Reservations: Everything below that isn't listed as TBD is already booked (including restaurants).  These are ""the bones"" of our trip.  We can add some meat where there are gaps, so I'd love any feedback on how to fill them up.  

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1 - Friday:

\- Fly into SF, pick up rental car and head to Napa

\- Lunch: TBD in SF

\- 5PM: Twilight tour &amp; tasting @ Mondavi

\- 9PM: Dinner @ Ad Hoc

Day 2 - Saturday:

\- 10AM: Tasting @ Spring Mountain Vineyards

\- Lunch: TBD, would love recommendations in this area

\- 12PM: Tasting @ Heitz Cellars

\- 2PM: Tasing @ Frog's Leap

\- 7:30PM: Dinner @ Auberge du Soleil 

&amp;#x200B;

Day 3 - Sunday:

\- 6:30AM: Hot Air Balloon Ride (!!!)

\- 12:30PM: Tour &amp; Tasting @ B Cellars

\- 3PM: Tour &amp; Tasting @ Domaine Carneros

\- 7:30PM: Dinner @ Mustard's Grill

&amp;#x200B;

Day 4 - Monday:

\- 10AM: Tour &amp; Tasting @ Schramsberg

\- Lunch: TBD, would love recommendations in this area (Calistoga)

\- 12:30: Couples Spa (Mud Baths FTW) in Calistoga

\- 8PM: Dinner @ French Laundry 

&amp;#x200B;

Some input that would be helpful:

\- Lunch recommendations

\- As mentioned, the wife is big on Sauvignon Blanc.  I've got Mondavi and Frog's Leap on here which I believe has a SB, but she might get red fatigue with the tastings as I have them.  I keep thinking about trying to fit in one more stop, ideally some place with great whites, on Saturday.  Matthiasson sits at the front of my mind.  Thoughts?

\- Transportation: we'll have a rental, but should we get a driver on Saturday?  I planned all of these somewhat close together so that we had options, but would love feedback from folks more familiar with the area.

I’m a fan of Julian Sunier’s wines, specifically the Morgan and the Régnié, but recently opened a 2016 and was disappointed as it was a bit too acidic.

The 2015s were great, so I’m wondering if it’s a simple issue of vintage? The bottle had been stored at around 70 degrees F in a cabinet in my apartment for less than a year. 

This was transported to Colombia in my luggage so I am wondering if something may have compromised the bottle in transit?

What factors cause a wine to become more acidic than a similar bottle by the same producer? Something similar happened to me recently with a 2016 Lapierre Morgon, but that was not transported anywhere. Was 2016 simply a bad year for Gamay in Beaujolais?

wine,awtzop,"After a long time of personal effort, I'm pleased to announce that I've completed the first version of the app I've designed for Android devices. Its name is ***Wine Routes*** and it is designed as a tool for all wine lovers.

The idea originally came up while I was looking to find out about the wineries in Greece, their products and their location. Unfortunately, I found that the available data was inadequate and usually related to the popular wineries displayed on wine websites. This was the case until I discovered a PDO / PGI Winemaking Registry: a simple excel file with no mechanical readability of this public information, negating the possibility of being classified as ""open data"". So, I proceeded to a mass processing of the data of this Registry, with the harder point of manually locating each winery separately. It was a time-consuming task but led to a total of nearly 700 wineries with detailed data and geographic location. The next thought was: Who needs this data? Who wants to know where each winery is located? The answer was: whoever wants to visit the wineries.

Here lies the central idea of the application: the winelover can browse the map, explore the wineries and plan a winery visit route or follow a proposed route. If he/she has visited wineries, he/she can record his/her view of them, as well as save his/her routes. Each route is designed, based on an algorithm, based on shortest distance or shorter duration. The long-term goal of the application is to promote wine tourism not only for the popular but for all wineries in Greece, giving the opportunity to show new winemakers as well as to promote the Greek wine worldwide as the application is not only for Greece but for all winelovers.

The app is officially released and available for free at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes). More details can be found on the application's website at [wineroutes.eu](http://wineroutes.eu/). I would be glad if you tried out the app and offered any advice/remarks about the content. Who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

As i jump start my collection due to my father who wants to be able to enjoy good wine while visiting (this sounds spoiled... i understand i am incredibly lucky to get this gift), i get to buy 60ish bottles of wine with an average of 40 dollars a bottle. I live close to a total wine so i think its best to start there.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i want the following split in the selection. Most of these wine will be for major events and get to age for a while. The rest of my collection will be smaller buys and from trips/subscriptions.

&amp;#x200B;

France - Bordeaux - 5 st. emilion, 4 pauillac, 3 margaux  
France - Rhone - 5 sections village, 5 cornas, 5 cdp (maybe even cote rotie?)  
France - Burgundy - 5 from cote'dor

Spain: 5 Riojas or suggestion

Italy: 5 Brunellos?, 3 from the Piedmont area and 3 Tuscan. I buy a lot of one offs from around Italy. Maybe 4 from the heel or sardinia?  


USA: 3-5 pinot noirs and 5 cabernets.

&amp;#x200B;

We can up the numbers. The goal would be to select some good wines, multiples of the same wine so I can learn and taste how they evolve over time?  


Any help would be appreciated. This is not sponsored by total wine though i am willing to accept handouts or sponsorship. (Sponsorship in terms of wine, not AA)

We are wine drinkers (mid-Atlantic), and have some know-how, have gone to some competitions, and am familiar with the top wines in our state.

These findings gave a new catalyst for the Armenian wine producers to ameliorate their winemaking practices and educate the society on the noble tradition of wine drinking. 

The huge interest towards Armenian wine has given birth to amazing festivals such as YereWine Days (usually celebrated in May) and Areni Wine Festival (celebrated in October).

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/u8dsypnvz1i21.jpg

## Areni Wine Festival

Areni Wine Festival is the major wine festival of Armenia. It was first organized in 2009. The peculiarity of the festival is that it takes place immediately next to the famous Areni Cave, which is considered to be the very first cradle of wine. In fact, Areni Cave is the oldest winery cave ever discovered in the world.

Imagine, how much will you enjoy attending a wine festival near the world’s oldest winery. This is surely going to be a remarkable experience and a day to remember!

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/66ke2omxz1i21.jpg

As it is Armenia’s greatest wine festival, it goes without saying that you will be drinking a lot of wine. Actually, you will have a sheer opportunity to try the most popular Armenian wines that are quite successful in the local and European market. You just cannot miss this chance to taste wines of the country that is factually the pioneer of winemaking.

The opening ceremony of Areni Wine Festival begins with a colourful and remarkable parade of winemakers, followed by different competitions, songs and dances.

## Yerevan Wine Days

If you are travelling to Armenia in May you definitely have to find some time to attend Yerevan Wine Days. This two-day festival, open-air party, wine lovers gathering or call it the way you like brings together thousands of people from different countries to taste Armenian wine.

At the event are represented almost all the wine producers of Armeniaand Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh), so you will get a chance to try wines made of different types of grapes from different regions (from North to South, from East to West) in one place. You will feel the taste of the Armenian Sun in each glass.

I've always loved wine. Im originally from Belgium, so i started tasting at a young age. I moved to the USA and started buying wine on my own mostly for dinner etc during college and have progressed from Barefoot to better wines and now a stronger lean back to the old world.

My father loves wines and while we always serve him well, has taken it upon himself to improve the collections of their kids. I now need to invest in a larger wine fridge (currently only have a small one) and a collection starting around 60 bottles. 60 bottles with an average price of 40 bucks. The goal is to keep some of these bottles long term, some less long. Perhaps do vertical tastings down the road etc...

I dont really know how to start though, aside from thanking him a lot... In France we used to just go to wineries and buy crates and magnums that were fantastic for 15 euros. Here in the USA, wine seems to cost a lot more. Wine from Europe is also riskier to buy here i think.  


How would i best go about starting this collection. Should i contact stores to help me make a selection? Maybe go to total wine?

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair a nice bottle with three different meals, in so far as possible.

As usual, I'm aware it is hard (impossible?) to find a perfect pairing with these options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, but I'd like to find something to carry us through. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. Not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed.

They are:

Chickpea Lemon Stuffed Sweet Potato (http://www.asplashofvanilla.com/2015/07/05/baked-sweet-potatoes-with-spicy-lemon-chickpeas/) Possibly combined with a grilled eggplant

Egg in Coconut Tomato Sauce (http://yummilyyours.com/egg-drop-curry/) Possibly combined with some rice

Jackfruit Burger (http://mygoodnesskitchen.com/easy-creole-jackfruit-burger/) Possibly combined with fennel, pumpkin or zucchini fries

What would you recommend? We have a fairly varied cellar (though some notable wines are lacking).

Multiple suggestions both red and white, if possible, so we can select a good bottle.

My main thought was going out to a Viognier, a South African Ridgeback since (1) it is from 2009 and so should be drunk quickly and (2) it might be medium and balanced enough to match all 3 dishes.

wine,asa74b,"I like cheap wine. Sometimes it’s tasty and sometimes it’s terrible. It’s a stupid but kind of fun treasure hunt of a game. Looking back on the last few bottles I’ve been totally burned by though, I think I was suckered into buying them because of the neat art work or use of “buzz words.” Reserve! Must be good! It’s not. I’ve also been trying to avoid cheap French and Italian wines, thinking (for no particular reason) that I can find a more tasty bottle from Argentina or Portugal for a few bucks less.

Am I seeing a pattern where none exists, or are there actually some good rules of thumb when bargain hunting?

wine,as79zq,"Here’s a bit of background to add context to my question.  I’m not new to wine but having grown up in Napa, my point of reference for a long time was varietals common in CA.  In the last year I’ve spent a lot of time on wine and food pairings, which has helped me learn a great deal more about varietals outside of the US.  So far I’m self taught and while I have started to better understand regions in Italy let’s say, I’ve almost purposely avoided France as it seems super confusing. 

My overall learning goal is to be able to go to a great restaurant and understand all the varietals presented and be knowledgable about them, and how they might pair with food.  I feel I’ve made tremendous progress for Italy through a ton of reading and some tasting. 

Given that the way French wine is labeled on a menu doesn’t always indicate the varietal (or maybe I missed something), how do you start to decipher the “code”.  With so many AOCs and classifications, I don’t know where to begin! ",Learning about French wine....where does one start?,corkandspoon,1550557015.0,6,0

I made an “accidental splash” this past week: We had two wines on sale (Schug and Freeman PN) and I sold a bottle of each in one night and a few nights later a bottle of Caymus Napa Cab. Yay me - EXCEPT I really didn’t do any work for them!  However, I would like to turn these nights into actual education to build my wine sales skills. 

Yes, those bottles are now on a short list to buy and try as funds become available.  I’m also taking a wine course provided by the new job and participating in wine tastings as often as they are presented. Surely, there’s something I can do tableside though - would it be a faux pas to ask a guest why they chose a specific bottle?  Obviously not if the table doesn’t read that way; but what cues might I be missing to make that conversation?

the AOP system (or the appellation d'origine protégée) has appellation d'origine protégée as the ""top tier"". with the previous top tier appellation being AoC (or Appellation d'origine contrôlée)

1. if AoP system is newer, why is it that in the [2011 Olga Raffault Les Picasses](https://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=2106991) they have the AoP system, while in the newer vintage, they have the [older system](https://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=2864598&amp;searchId=B7899348%23selected%253DW2864598_2_K681fcce4ea52451e64c5c79be2d38fe8).

how is it that in the older vintage, they are using the NEWER system. but in the newer vintage, they are using the older system? or do those appellation mean something totally different?

wine,as0zbc,"Hello all,

First time posting here. I read the sidebar so I don't think this post/question violates any of the rules.

My question: Is anyone aware of a wine producer, vendor, or online club that creates or sells wine for learning purposes. *For instance*, a producer who sells exactly the same wine (i.e., uses the same grapes from the same 'terroir', same production techniques and idiosyncrasies specific to that producer) except that they create one wine aged in an oak barrel and the other ages in a steel barrel. *Or maybe* they produce the same wine, but one was fermented twice or fermented longer than the other. *Or maybe* one wine that was harvested at the normal time and one late harvest. The point being to taste these wines side-by-side so that other variables affecting the final product are eliminated (as much as possible) so that a learner can discover how each of these factors (barrel type, fermentation length, harvest time, etc.) affect the wine individually.

Thanks!

wine,as0817,"My wife and I will be visiting France in April and I am trying to setup a few winery visits in Bordeaux while we're there.  We are not wine professionals, but we really love wine and try to visit wineries whenever we travel to a new place.  

We will be in Bordeaux for 3-4 days and I've sent messages to nearly a dozen different wineries, asking to schedule a tour and tasting during that time.  However, a few have replied that I would need to schedule the visit through a ""negociant"" and frankly I am out of my depth here.  Perhaps I'm just the typical ""stupid American"" but I really have no idea how to go about doing this.  Also, my wife and I are not wealthy (or even close to it) so our visits will be limited to 2nd/3rd Growth vineyards and below.  We can't afford the Grand Cru Bordeaux prices, so that's not an option.  

I have found the names of a few of these firms that are considered negociants (Tastet-Lawton, Balaresque, etc), but their websites require a login so I'm not sure if it's restricted for those in the wine industry.  

Anyway, if anyone could help me out or point me in the right direction I would be immensely appreciative.  I'm not trying to be obtuse - scheduling visits in Spain and Italy was fairly easy, and obviously the vast majority of US wineries are very easy to visit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/2u4d8e/can_anyone_recommend_a_decent_wine_that_you_find/co5sew5/

the user states 

&gt;Kendall-Jackson Vintners Reserve - Not bad. These wines are never very exciting, but get the job done without excessive manipulation, being over-ripe or having lots of residual sugar. This is also the first brand on the list that has good varietal character - if you drink a Pinot from them, you know it's a Pinot, etc. Their more specifically appellated Jackson Estate series are actually quite good if you can find them - you'll know them because they'll have a specific appellation on the bottle rather than just ""California"".

What does this user mean by manipulation when it comes to wine making? Do some winemakers nowadays add synthetic, or processed additions to wine in their production line? Do they not go with the natural process? 

I assume the MASS produced industry wine companies do, as well as ""box wine"" companies. But I always assumed that majority of locations kept the traditional integrity of wine making. is this not the case?

if not, how can i know? how can i know that the next wine someone is drinking isnt ""good"" to their taste buds because the company added alot of ""X"" ingredient to it? (i.e. i guess extra sugar)

I've been a amateur wine enthusiast for years now, and I'm finally looking for something to store some of my more expensive bottles. I want to start letting them age. (6 months-2 years)

I live in Chicago and I don't have AC, so in the summer my apartment can easily get 70+ degrees, and in the winter my building can get quite cold and drafty when the heat isn't on.

I usually only hold around 12 bottles at a time, so a little 18 cooler is perfect for my needs.

I've been primarily a craft beer drinker but have always enjoyed wine when the opportunity came up. 

I wasn't sure exactly how to get started so I went to my local wine shop and figured it would be a good idea to pick out a high-rated wine (within a good price range) from a variety of types. I purchased a Riesling (Lone Orchid, 2017), Pino Grigio (Conte Fini, Valdadige 2017), Cabernet Sauvignon (already familiar with this type), Sauvignon Blanc (Cottesbrook 2018), and Merlot (Radius, 2014) I've been doing research and even recently purchased a wine book by Wine Folly to learn more. For some reason I find it all very interesting. It’s fun trying different wines and exploring what I enjoy most.

When I smell the wine, I only pick up on two aromas at the most. I'm already a big fan of Riesling, especially ones from Washington State so far. I noticed lime and fruity scents. I watched a video of someone smell that same Riesling and named off 5-6 different aromas. Is this a skill that improves over time?  I guess this isn’t a big deal but something I’ve been thinking of.

I haven’t done any wine tastings yet but my wife has noticed my new interest and wants to take me soon.  What other steps should I be taking to further delve into and enjoy the world of wine?

So, as I study V&amp;E in college, I was contemplating whether or not I should start transitioning from wine retail/sales (my current position) to wine production and start looking for entry level work in cellars or anywhere else within the vineyards/wineries. Or if I should wait until after I graduate. 

\-I was planning on sending emails (introduction, resume and desires) to pretty much every winery/vineyard in the southern half of the state (Texas) and seeing if they have any work opportunities coming up in late spring/early summer.

Just curious, does anyone have any advice for obtaining that first wine production entry position? Is there any correct/incorrect way to go about it? Are the entry jobs mostly seasonal? Is there a really good job board/listing that you use or used?

wine,ap37ah,"I need to start by saying that i dont know anything about wine. But I am looking to buy a wine for someone.

she loves cab franc, and doing some research last time, learned that Olga Raffault Chinon is a good buy for a cab franc lover.

doing some reading on their estate, it seems like there are 3 expressions.

&gt;Les Picasses is aged the longest before release: a minimum of four years, mainly in old foudres, some of chestnut as well oak. This wine lives for decades, and the family has always maintained a deep library of back vintages, released periodically in minute quantities. The less brawny, younger-drinking Les Peuilles spends only 6-12 months in wood, and the earliest-release Les Barnabés sees no wood at all.

I found 2 Olga Raffault Chinon near me. 

1st one is this one https://imgur.com/a/eWsC3Ri which says Olga Raffault 2014 Chinon Les Picasses. which fits in 1 of the 3 shown above. (I notice it also says ""Appellation Chinon Controlee"")

2nd one however is this one https://imgur.com/a/fxcCXC0 . it doesnt say anything of the 3 above, but only ""Appellation d'Orgine Protegee""

ifi Olga Raffault releases wine fron 1 of the 3 locations in Chinon shown above, which is the wine in the 2nd image from? and why does it leave out that information?

and lastly, can someone help me out on learning what ""Appellation Chinon Controlee"" and ""Appellation d'Orgine Protegee"" means?

wine,aoqxj0,"Boyfriend took me to a dinner for my birthday a couple years ago. We get to the table, do a cheers, finish a glass of champagne. He tells me to order a bottle of wine and steps out for a smoke. 

As he leaves, the sommelier comes to the table to help me pick out a nice red. I was thinking that since the cheapest decent bottle was probably around the $200USD mark, it wouldn’t be greedy of me to keep my eye on a number around that bracket. I didn’t say a specific price range to the sommelier so when he ended up recommending one that was sure to hit the spot—and it did—I just went with the recommendation.

Let me just say now that I have very terrible vision, and even when I’m wearing my contacts it’s still just extremely bad. I know I gotta get that checked out but onward with the story.

I skimmed over the menu’s description just to confirm and of course checked the price. All was well, boyfriend came back, wine came, did a tasting. It was very nice but I’m a little shy to emote unless I’m already a little tipsy. But I confirmed to him basically like “yes this is really nice.” And he was just basically like “A...re you sure?” “Yes very nice! Perfect!” 

Neither boyfriend nor I even thought to take a picture of the bottle before the server poured the stuff into a decanter.

We were enjoying our dinner very much and at the end I went to the restroom and returned to see my boyfriend laughing his ass off. He said, you ordered ¥200000 (it happened in japan so that would be roughly about USD$2,000) wine? I thought he was joking and I was laughing and just like “wtf no are you joking?”

He showed me the receipt and I went pale. I missed an entire zero when I was reading the menu! I was crying in the train on the way home, feeling terrible. To this day I don’t know if his laugh was from genuine amusement or if he didn’t know how else to react. 

The THING that kills me, the one I’ll never be able to get over is... I don’t even have a photo of the bottle. I don’t remember its name. It was easily the best red I’ve tasted in a very good while, or even ever probably. I just can’t get over it. 

I’m also just imagining the staff were probably thinking “damn how special this girl think she is just because it’s her bday waiting for her man to leave the table to order some good shit”

TLDR: ordered and drank a bottle of wine I thought was ¥20000/USD$200 but in the price was an extra zero which I overlooked ",I just want to share a story about a wine situation that happened to me—a situation which I’m still not over and will never be able to get over,Maynaise88,1549705237.0,54,0

wine,aoin2d,"Hi,

In short, I found that I really like whites which are not too dry (dry Riesling) or too sweet (Moscato), not too tart (Sauv Blanc), and not overly floral (Pinot Griggio, Chardonnay).  SOMETIMES I am in mood for these, but it depends on the meal.

However, I recently tried a blend ([the Day Wines Vin de Day Blanc](http://daywines.orderport.net/product-details/0089/Day-Wines-2017-Vin-de-Days-Blanc), which is listed as: Pinot blanc 38%, Muller Thurgau 20%, Riesling 19%, Pinot Gris 18%, Muscat 5%) and really liked how balanced it was.  Not too sweet, not too dry, not too floral, not too tart. 

Aside from this particular wine, I found the closest way I could recreate this at home was by mixing an off-dry Riesling (or other off-dry German white) with, say, a dash of Dr. Loosen Riesling (which I find is a little too sweet).  

If you follow what I'm getting at, can anyone recommend me whites that already have this type of profile?  I imagine it could well be a Riesling with the right crisp balance, or maybe a Gewurtztraminer.  I've certainly tasted some wines at the Virginia wineries that are close to this.  And I have a friend who claims to have tried some Burgundy Chardonnays which fit this profile, although I'm skeptical...the closest I found to this was Macon Villages.
